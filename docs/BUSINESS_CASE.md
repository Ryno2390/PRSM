# PRSM Business Case: Decentralized AI Infrastructure for the Post-ChatGPT Era

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity**: The AI industry is approaching a $1.3 trillion market trapped in an unsustainable arms race that threatens both innovation and society. PRSM represents the first production-ready protocol to escape this "Kobayashi Maru" scenario through decentralized infrastructure that aligns economic incentives with human welfare.

**The Solution**: PRSM (Protocol for Recursive Scientific Modeling) is a complete decentralized AI ecosystem featuring recursive orchestration, MCP tool integration, Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus, and a novel token economy that rewards contribution over ownership.

**Market Position**: We are not competing in the LLM arms race—we are building the infrastructure that makes the arms race obsolete.

**Funding Need**: $15-25M Series A to complete Phase 3 production launch and achieve market leadership in decentralized AI infrastructure.

**Returns Potential**: Massive network effects in a trillion-dollar market with first-mover advantage in post-centralized AI architecture.
