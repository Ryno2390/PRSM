Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
========================================

PRSM's implementation of the Model Context Protocol for tool integration.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for connecting
AI applications with external tools and data sources. This module provides
a comprehensive MCP client implementation that allows PRSM to:

- Connect to MCP servers hosting tools and resources
- Discover available tools and their capabilities
- Execute tool calls with proper parameter validation
- Manage tool sessions and state
- Handle errors and rate limiting
- Provide security sandboxing for tool execution

Key Components:
- MCPClient: Core client for connecting to MCP servers
- ToolRegistry: Manages discovered tools and their metadata
- SessionManager: Handles tool sessions and state
- SecurityManager: Sandboxing and validation for tool execution
- ResourceManager: Access to external data sources via MCP

Usage:
    from prsm.integrations.mcp import MCPClient, ToolRegistry
    
    # Connect to an MCP server
    client = MCPClient("http://localhost:3000")
    await client.connect()
    
    # Discover available tools
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
    # Execute a tool
    result = await client.call_tool("weather", {"location": "San Francisco"})
