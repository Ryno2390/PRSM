> **"Where white light reveals its true intelligence"**  
> *Organizing human intelligence through Newton's spectrum of light refraction*

---

## 🌈 Organizational Philosophy

PRSM's organizational structure mirrors Newton's groundbreaking discovery that white light contains all colors of the spectrum. Just as a **prism** refracts white light into distinct wavelengths, PRSM refracts collective intelligence into seven specialized teams, each operating at their own "frequency" while contributing to the unified whole.

### **🔬 The Science of Organization**

- **🔬 NWTN** (Newton) → The scientific foundation of light refraction discovery
- **🌈 PRSM** (Prism) → Our organization refracts collective intelligence into specialized capabilities  
- **⚡ FTNS** (Photons) → The fundamental "particles" of human creativity and innovation
- **🎨 ROY G BIV** → Seven teams following the natural progression of the visible light spectrum

**Organizational Metaphor**: Raw human intelligence (white light) enters PRSM and is systematically organized into seven distinct, specialized teams (the color spectrum). Each team operates at its own "wavelength" and "frequency" while remaining fundamentally part of the same unified intelligence phenomenon.
