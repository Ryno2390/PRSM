# PRSM Technical Roadmap V2: Evidence-Based Validation Strategy

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Purpose:** Address technical reassessment findings with concrete validation roadmap  
**Classification:** Internal Strategy Document

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This roadmap directly addresses the critical gap identified in our technical reassessment: **the disconnect between architectural sophistication and operational validation evidence**. Our strategy shifts from claims-based development to evidence-driven validation, positioning PRSM as the reliable infrastructure foundation for post-centralized AI ecosystems.

**Core Strategic Pivot:** Transform PRSM from prototype to production-ready infrastructure through rigorous validation, transparency, and operational evidence.

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### High-Priority Red Flags (Score: 35/100)
1. **Validation Theater** - Claims without supporting evidence
2. **Implementation Depth** - Sophisticated frameworks with minimal operational proof
3. **Missing Evidence** - No test results, performance data, or operational metrics
4. **Economic Model Uncertainty** - Complex tokenomics without real-world validation

### Strategic Response Framework
- **Evidence-First Development** - All claims backed by verifiable data
- **Operational Transparency** - Real-time access to system metrics and test results
- **Independent Validation** - Third-party verification of all performance claims
