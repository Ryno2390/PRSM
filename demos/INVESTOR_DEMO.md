## 🤔 Anticipated Investor Questions & Responses

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: "How do you scale beyond simulation to real networks?"**
**A**: Our P2P demo uses the same algorithms that will run in production - libp2p, PBFT consensus, cryptographic signatures. The simulation validates the logic; production deployment scales it with battle-tested libraries. We have detailed scaling plans for 10K+ nodes.

**Q: "What about security and attack resistance?"**
**A**: Our tokenomics simulation includes bad actors (freeloaders) who attempt to game the system. The quality-weighted rewards and consensus mechanisms prevent attacks. Production will add full cryptography, audited smart contracts, and bug bounty programs.

**Q: "How does this compete with OpenAI/Google?"**
**A**: We don't compete - we create the efficiency frontier. While they scale by adding more compute, we scale by getting smarter with existing resources. Our non-profit structure enables unique advantages like academic partnerships and global public good positioning.

### **Business Questions**

**Q: "How do you make money as a non-profit?"**
**A**: We take 2-5% transaction fees to cover operations. All surplus is redistributed to FTNS token holders quarterly. This creates aligned incentives - our success directly benefits our community, not external shareholders.

**Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
**A**: Phase 1: Research institutions (grants/academic partnerships). Phase 2: Enterprise pilot programs. Phase 3: Developer ecosystem growth. Our non-profit status opens doors that for-profit competitors can't access.

**Q: "How do you prevent other teams from copying this?"**
**A**: Our competitive moat is the non-profit structure itself - it can't be copied by for-profit competitors. Plus network effects, SEAL technology integration, and first-mover advantage in efficiency-focused decentralized AI.

### **Investment Questions**

**Q: "What specific milestones justify the $18M ask?"**
**A**: Tranche 1 ($6M): Production deployment + team hiring. Tranche 2 ($7M): Enterprise partnerships + scaling. Tranche 3 ($5M): Global expansion + ecosystem growth. Clear deliverables and success metrics for each phase.

**Q: "What are the biggest risks?"**
**A**: Technical: Scaling challenges (mitigated by proven architecture). Market: Slow enterprise adoption (mitigated by research partnerships). Regulatory: Token compliance (mitigated by legal-first approach and non-profit structure).

**Q: "What's your exit strategy for investors?"**
**A**: As a non-profit, there's no traditional exit. Instead, FTNS token appreciation provides returns through network growth. Impact investors get mission alignment plus financial upside through token value and quarterly distributions.
