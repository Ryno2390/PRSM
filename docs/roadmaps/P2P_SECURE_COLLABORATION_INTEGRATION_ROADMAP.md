# P2P Secure Collaboration Integration Roadmap

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Status**: Development Planning  
**Priority**: High - Revolutionary Feature Set  

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the integration of **P2P/torrent-based secure collaboration** and **enterprise-grade collaboration tools** into PRSM's existing collaboration framework. By combining cryptographic file sharding with proven collaboration platforms like ONLYOFFICE, PRSM will offer unprecedented secure collaboration capabilities that eliminate centralized server dependencies while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality.

### Core Innovation: "Coca Cola Recipe" Security Model
Files are cryptographically sharded and distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring that no single party (including non-collaborating nodes) has access to complete files. Only authorized collaborators possess the cryptographic keys needed to reassemble and decrypt the distributed pieces.

## 🌟 Vision Statement

**"Transform PRSM into the world's first P2P-secured collaborative research platform where sensitive intellectual property can be shared and co-developed without traditional centralized server risks."**

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Existing PRSM Collaboration Infrastructure ✅
Based on analysis of `PRSM_ui_mockup/index.html`, PRSM already includes:

- **Real-time chat and channels** with team communication
- **Project-based workspaces** with member management
- **Kanban boards and task management** for workflow coordination
- **File sharing capabilities** with basic permissions
- **Team formation and invitation systems**
- **Multi-channel communication** (general, research, publications)
- **Integration-ready UI framework** with tabbed collaboration interface

### Integration Opportunities 🎯
1. **Enhance existing file sharing** with P2P cryptographic security
2. **Integrate ONLYOFFICE** for advanced document collaboration
3. **Add secure workspace creation** with distributed file architecture
4. **Implement cryptographic access controls** for sensitive research data
5. **Create hybrid collaboration modes** (traditional + P2P)
