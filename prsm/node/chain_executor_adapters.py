"""Sprint 592 (Phase 2A) — chain-executor send-message adapter scaffolding.

Sprint 578 plumbed PRSM_PARALLAX_CHAIN_EXECUTOR_KIND=rpc as a hook
for the real ``make_rpc_chain_executor`` factory. Phase 2 wiring
requires bridging the gap between:

- ``SendMessage = Callable[[str, bytes], bytes]`` (factory contract;
  SYNC; address → response bytes); see
  ``prsm/compute/chain_rpc/client.py``
- ``transport.send_to_peer(peer_id, P2PMessage) -> bool`` (async;
  awaits + does not return response bytes directly)

This module scaffolds the adapter contract. Phase 2A (sprint 592)
introduces the type signature + Protocol + a NotImplementedError
placeholder ``build_send_message_adapter()``. Phase 2B (sprint 593)
adds the address-resolver helper. Phase 2C (sprint 594) implements
the async-to-sync bridge using ``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``.
Phase 2D (sprint 595) wires it into ``_build_chain_executor``.

This staged approach keeps each sprint scoped + reviewable. The
scaffolding lets test code reference the eventual contract today.
