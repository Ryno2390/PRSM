      "title": "Toward All 2D-based Printed Raindrop Triboelectric Nanogenerators",
      "abstract": "The raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (RD-TENG) is an emerging technology that is designed to harvest energy from raindrops. This application requires materials with negative triboelectric effect, high surface charge density, mechanical flexibility, and a large surface area, which are key characteristics of 2D materials. However, fundamental research is necessary to understand the potential of 2D materials in this context. This study introduces all-2D-based RD-TENG devices using graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) and liquid cascade centrifugation are used for nanosheet preparation and size selection. The TENGs are fabricated through a rapid, low-cost solution deposition technique based on liquid-liquid interface deposition, which allows screening of different active films and device geometries. Among the tested layered materials, medium-sized molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets (average lateral size~160 nm, volume-fraction weighted average layer number ~9) exhibit the highest short-circuit current (microampere per drop) and voltage (mV per drop) output due to their most suited electron affinity, capacitance, and surface charge exchange properties. The variations in the performance of the TMD films were further evaluated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), showing the influence of oxidation differences on charge transfer and charge decay time.",

      "title": "Finite deformations induce friction hysteresis in normal wavy contacts",
      "abstract": "Since Hertz's pioneering work in 1882, contact mechanics traditionally grounds on linear elasticity, assuming small strains and displacements. However, recent experiments clearly highlighted linear elasticity limitations in accurately predicting the contact behaviour of rubbers and elastomers, particularly during frictional slip, which is governed by geometric and material nonlinearity. In this study, we investigate the basic scenario involving normal approach-retraction contact cycles between a wavy rigid indenter and a flat, deformable substrate. Both frictionless and frictional interfacial conditions are examined, considering finite strains, displacements, and nonlinear rheology. We developed a finite element model for this purpose and compared our numerical results with Westergaard's linear theory. Our findings show that, even in frictionless conditions, the contact response is significantly influenced by geometric and material nonlinearity, particularly for wavy indenters with high aspect ratios, where normal-tangential stresses and displacements coupling emerges. More importantly, interfacial friction in nonlinear elasticity leads to contact hysteresis (i.e., frictional energy dissipation) during normal loading-unloading cycles. This behavior cannot be explained in a linear framework; therefore, most of the experiments reporting hysteresis are typically explained invoking other interfacial phenomena (e.g., adhesion, plasticity, or viscoelasticity). Here we present an additional suitable explanation relying on finite strains/displacements with detailed peculiarities, such as vanishing pull-off force. Moreover, we also report an increase of hysteretic losses as for confined systems, stemming from the enhanced normal-tangential nonlinear coupling.",

      "abstract": "Recently-demonstrated high-quality three-dimensional (3D) subsurface laser processing inside crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers opens a door to a wide range of novel applications in multidisciplinary research areas. Using this technique, a novel maskless micro-pillars with precise control on the surface reflection and coverage are successfully fabricated by etching the laser processed region of c-Si wafer. To achieve this, a particular selective wet chemical etching is developed to follow subsurface laser processing of c-Si to reveal the desired 3D structures with smooth surfaces. Here, we report the development of a novel chromium-free chemical etching recipe based on copper nitrate, which yields substantially smooth surfaces at high etch rate and selectivity on the both laser-processed Si surface and subsurface, i.e., without significant etching of the unmodified Si. Our results show that the etch rate and surface morphology are interrelated and strongly influenced by the composition of the adopted etching solution. After an extensive compositional study performed at room temperature, we identify an etchant with a selectivity of over 1600 times for laser-modified Si with respect to unmodified Si. We also support our findings using density functional theory calculations of HF and Cu adsorption energies, indicating significant diversity on the c-Si and laser-modified surfaces.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of active mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through changes in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved considerable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or alter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation within these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a magneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such a system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for transitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations. Additionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure, facilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency ranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration process. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties and behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications, including robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.",

      "abstract": "Drop-on-demand inkjet printing is a promising and commercially relevant technology for producing organic electronic devices of arbitrary shape on a wide variety of different substrates. In this work we transfer the inkjet printing process of organic photovoltaic devices from 2D to 3D substrates, using a 5-axis robot system equipped with a multi nozzle inkjet printing unit. We present a ready-to-use 3D printing system for industrial application, using a 5-axis motion system controlled by commercial 3D motion software, combined with a commonly used multi-nozzle inkjet print head controlled by the corresponding printing software. The very first time inkjet-printed solar cells on glass/ITO with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 7% are realized on a 3D object with surfaces tilted by angles of up to 60{\\deg} against the horizontal direction. Undesired ink flow during deposition of the inkjet-printed layers was avoided by proper ink formulation. In order to be able to print organic (opto-)electronic devices also on substrates without sputtered indium tin oxide bottom electrode, the bottom electrode was inkjet-printed from silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink, resulting in the first all inkjet-printed (i.e., including bottom electrode) solar cell on a 3D object ever with a record PCE of 2.5%. This work paves the way for functionalizing even complex objects, such as cars, mobile phones, or Internet of Things (IoT) applications with inkjet-printed (opto-)electronic devices.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in soft, sticker_like electronics, few efforts have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing an eco friendly conductive ink for thin_film circuitry composed of silver flakes and a water_based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical conductivity (1.6 x 105 S m_1), high resolution digital printability, robust adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability. Recycling is achieved with an ecologically friendly processing method to decompose the circuits into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only 2.4 per cent in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up to 200 per cent strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps. Finally, on_skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable foods are demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a unique opportunity to create a flexible platform, akin to electronic field programmable gate array (FPGA). These photonic PGAs can implement versatile functionalities for applications ranging from optical interconnects to microwave photonics. However, state-of-the-art programmable photonics relies predominantly on volatile thermo-optic tuning, which suffers from high static power consumption, large footprints, and thermal crosstalk. All these dramatically limit the gate density and pose a fundamental limit to the scalability. Chalcogenide-based phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a superior alternative due to their nonvolatility and substantial optical contrast, though challenges such as optical loss, and bit precision severely limited their application in large-scale PICs. Here, we demonstrate precise, multi-bit, low-loss tuning of the emerging PCM Sb2Se3 using a closed-loop, \"program-and-verify\" method. Electrically reconfigurable PCM-integrated silicon photonic gates are implemented on a 300mm silicon photonic platform, using circulating and forward Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) meshes. In the circulating mesh, we realize broadband optical switching fabrics and high-Q coupled resonators with unprecedented local control of coupling rates, which further enable exploration of coupled-cavity systems. The forward mesh supports self-configurable MZIs that sort two orthogonal beams to different ports. These results showcase a new type of scalable photonic PGA enabled by PCMs, offering a pathway toward general-purpose, on-chip programmable photonic systems.",

      "abstract": "The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.",

      "title": "Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in   gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas",
      "abstract": "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.",

      "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) origami tessellations such as the Miura-ori are often generalized to build three-dimensional (3D) architected materials with sandwich or cellular structures. However, such 3D blocks are densely packed with continuity of the internal material, while for many engineering structures with multi-physical functionality, it is necessary to have thin sheets that are separately spaced and sparsely connected. This work presents a framework for the design and analysis of multi-layered spaced origami, which provides an origami solution for 3D structures where multiple flat sheets are intentionally spaced apart. We connect Miura-ori sheets with sparsely installed thin-sheet parallelogram-like linkages. To explore how this connectivity approach affects the behavior of the origami system, we model the rigid-folding kinematics using analytic trigonometry and rigid-body transformations, and we characterize the elastic-folding mechanics by generalizing a reduced order bar and hinge model for these 3D assemblies. The orientation of the linkages in the multi-layered spaced origami determines which of three folding paths the system will follow including a flat foldable type, a self-locking type, and a double-branch type. When the origami is flat foldable, a maximized packing ratio and a uniform in-plane shear stiffness can be achieved by strategically choosing the link orientation. We show possible applications by demonstrating how the multi-layered spaced origami can be used to build deployable acoustic cloaks and heat shields.",

      "abstract": "Chiral processes that lack mirror symmetry pervade nature from enantioselective molecular interactions to the asymmetric development of organisms. An outstanding challenge at the interface between physics and biology consists in bridging the multiple scales between microscopic and macroscopic chirality. Here, we combine theory, experiments and modern inference algorithms to study a paradigmatic example of dynamic chirality transfer across scales: the generation of tissue-scale flows from subcellular forces. The distinctive properties of our microscopic graph model and the corresponding coarse-grained viscoelasticity are that (i) net cell proliferation is spatially inhomogeneous and (ii) cellular dynamics cannot be expressed as an energy gradient. To overcome the general challenge of inferring microscopic model parameters from noisy high-dimensional data, we develop a nudged automatic differentiation algorithm (NADA) that can handle large fluctuations in cell positions observed in single tissue snapshots. This data-calibrated microscopic model quantitatively captures proliferation-driven tissue flows observed at large scales in our experiments on fibroblastoma cell cultures. Beyond chirality, our inference algorithm can be used to extract interpretable graph models from limited amounts of noisy data of living and inanimate cellular systems such as networks of convection cells and flowing foams.",

During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.",

In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement.

      "abstract": "Atomically thin, single-crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on sapphire substrates exhibit exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, positioning them as excellent channel materials for flexible electronics. However, conventional wet-transfer processes for integrating these materials onto flexible substrates often introduce surface contamination, significantly degrading device performance. Here, we present a wafer-scale dry-transfer technique using a high-dielectric oxide as the transfer medium, enabling the integration of 4-inch single-crystalline MoS$_2$ onto flexible substrates. This method eliminates contact with polymers or solvents, thus preserving the intrinsic electronic properties of MoS$_2$. As a result, the fabricated flexible field-effect transistor (FET) arrays exhibit remarkable performance, with a mobility of 117 cm$^2$/Vs, a subthreshold swing of 68.8 mV dec$^{-1}$, and an ultra-high current on/off ratio of $10^{12}$-values comparable to those achieved on rigid substrates. Leveraging the outstanding electrical characteristics, we demonstrated MoS$_2$-based flexible inverters operating in the subthreshold regime, achieving both a high gain of 218 and ultra-low power consumption of 1.4 pW/$\\mu$m. Additionally, we integrated a flexible tactile sensing system driven by active-matrix MoS$_2$ FET arrays onto a robotic gripper, enabling real-time object identification. These findings demonstrate the simultaneous achievement of high electrical performance and flexibility, highlighting the immense potential of single-crystalline TMDC-based flexible electronics for real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.",

Unlike in other models of active liquid crystals, the balance between energy injection and dissipation can here involve multiple length scales, resulting in a large spectrum of dynamical behaviors. When kinetic energy is dissipated by the cells' adhesive interactions at a rate higher that at which is injected by active stresses, the quiescent state of the cellular layer is generically stable: i.e. hydrodynamically stable regardless of its size. On the other hand, as the cellular layer becomes progressively more active, this homeostatic condition is altered by a hierarchy of pattern-forming instabilities, where the system organizes in an increasingly large number of counter-flowing lanes of fixed width. In two-dimensional periodic domains, the latter organization is itself unstable to the proliferation of vortices and the dynamics of the cellular layer becomes eventually chaotic and yet different from the more common active turbulence.",

Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.",

However, the lack of axial force measurement from the robot remains a major challenge, as it can lead to excessive colonic elongation, perforation, or ureteral complications. Although various methods have been proposed in previous studies, limitations such as model dependency, bulkiness, and environmental sensitivity remain challenges that should be addressed before clinical application. In this study, we propose EndoForce, a device designed for intuitive and accurate axial force measurement in endoscopic robotic systems. Inspired by the insertion motion performed by medical doctors during ureteroscopy and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, EndoForce ensures precise force measuring while maintaining compatibility with clinical environments. The device features a streamlined design, allowing for the easy attachment and detachment of a sterile cover, and incorporates a commercial load cell to enhance cost-effectiveness and facilitate practical implementation in real medical applications. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed EndoForce, physical experiments were performed using a testbed that simulates the ureter. We show that the axial force generated during insertion was measured with high accuracy, regardless of whether the pathway was straight or curved, in a testbed simulating the human ureter.",

In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.",

      "abstract": "Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between cellular packing and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cell pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a geometric method to quantify their rheology using only imaging data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.",

The proposed approach accounts for internal heat generation and non-homogeneities in the heat diffusion equation. The separation of variables (SOV) method is employed to decouple spatial and temporal components, enabling the determination of eigenvalues. The orthogonal expansion (OE) technique is then applied to compute Fourier coefficients using 'natural' orthogonality. An analytical solution for composites with constant heat sources is developed by combining the SOV method and OE technique. Additionally, a Green's function (GF) based approach is formulated to handle transient heat sources and other non-homogeneous conditions, including temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. The results demonstrate that the proposed method offers significantly faster computations compared to finite element (FE) methods, while maintaining high accuracy. This forward modeling approach serves as an efficient basis for inverse modeling, aimed at estimating unknown material properties and geometric deformations, which are explored in Part II of this study.",

However, achieving precise shape transformation and mechanical property control remains challenging due to nonlinearity, design constraints, and the difficulty of coordinating multiple constituent materials across a continuous surface. To this end, this study unveils that Kirigami art can inspire novel solutions. More specifically, the geometric principles of Kirigami can be exploited to design and fabricate fluidic metasurfaces capable of highly accurate shape morphing and output force control, all via a single pressure input. This study presents a systematic approach to designing Kirigami for tuning the local deformation and force output through extensive nonlinear modeling and experiment validation on two archetypal patterns: concentric square and circular cuts. The potentials of this approach are demonstrated via two multiphysics case studies: (1) an acoustic holography lens for ultrasonic wave steering, achieving highly accurate deformation control under a single global pressure input, and (2) a haptic device with a small volume, constant contact area, and high-resolution output force. The fluidic Kirigami concept allows for simple yet effective adaptation to different shape and stiffness requirements, paving the way for a new family of scalable and programmable morphing surfaces.",

This implies that the excess isochoric heat capacity scales as $C_{\\rm v}^{\\rm ex}\\propto T^{-2/5}$. Careful examination performed in this paper demonstrates that the exponent $-2/5$ is not always optimal. For instance, in the Lennard-Jones fluid in some vicinity of the triple point, the exponent $-1/3$ turns out to be more appropriate. The analysis of the specific heat data in neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and liquid mercury reveals that no single value of the exponent exists, describing all the data simultaneously. Therefore we propose a generalized RT scaling in the form $C_{\\rm v}^{\\rm ex}\\propto T^{-\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is a density- and material-dependent adjustable parameter.

In this paper, we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a narrow channel containing a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional bichromatic potential introduced by Aubry and Andr\\'e (AA) to study the propagation and localization of waves. When the boulder landscape is strictly periodic, the robot can pass completely through the channel. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot can become trapped and fail to exit the channel. The metrics we use to quantify this change agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot's motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe.",

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal humanoids have various biomimetic advantages, and the redundant muscle arrangement allowing for variable stiffness control is one of the most important. In this study, we focus on one feature of the redundancy, which enables the humanoid to keep moving even if one of its muscles breaks, an advantage that has not been dealt with in many studies. In order to make the most of this advantage, the design of muscle arrangement is optimized by considering the maximization of minimum available torque that can be exerted when one muscle breaks. This method is applied to the elbow of a musculoskeletal humanoid Musashi with simulations, the design policy is extracted from the optimization results, and its effectiveness is confirmed with the actual robot.",

      "abstract": "This study sequentially investigates the enhancement of fracture behavior in adhesive joints. Initially, mechanical sanding techniques were explored, revealing significant improvements of 55% in fracture energy and 38% in load-bearing capacity with optimal 240-grit sanding. Subsequently, in a second stage, Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) were introduced at varying weight percentages (0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% by weight) into the adhesive joints. This combined approach aimed to synergistically examine the impact of surface pretreatments and nanoparticle integration on fracture behavior. Results highlight the potential for fracture resistance and enhanced load-carrying capabilities in reinforced specimens, with maximum load and fracture energy improvements of up to 92 % and 50 %, respectively, compared to unreinforced specimens and those subjected solely to sanding treatments. Furthermore, the fracture mode shifted from adhesive failure to cohesive substrate failure in reinforced specimens. This comprehensive investigation underscores the intricate interplay between mechanical preparation and nanomaterial incorporation in significantly improving adhesive joint performance",

      "abstract": "Small-scale structures on biological surfaces can profoundly impact how animals move, appear, and interact with their environments. Such textures may be especially important for limbless reptiles, such as snakes and legless lizards, because their skin serves as the primary interface with the world around them. Here, we examine ventral microstructures of several limbless reptiles, which are hypothesized to be highly specialized to aid locomotion via frictional interactions. Inspired by prior studies that investigated potential links between microtextures, phylogeny, habitat, and locomotion -- but that were limited by their reliance on shed skins -- we characterized the structures present on preserved museum specimens and found that they are quantitatively similar to those found on shed skins. Using this result, we confirmed a previously hypothesized -- but untested due to the lack of shed skins -- third independent evolution of sidewinding-specific isotropic microtexture. Specifically, we examined a museum-preserved \\textit{Bitis peringueyi} specimen and identified a new instance of convergent evolution in sidewinding viper microstructures: the loss of micro-spikes (present on many snake species) and the appearance of micro-pits with a characteristic spacing. Our results reveal that museum-preserved specimens retain intact microtextures, greatly expanding the availability of samples for evolutionary studies.",

      "abstract": "Transport of microscopic objects across biological membranes usually involves membrane deformation to enclose the object followed by detachment of the engulfed particle. However, in artificial membranes, this last topological remodelling step is in many cases not spontaneous due to the elastic stability of the neck structure formed upon complete particle wrapping. In this work, we use optical trapping to induce the wrapping of a non-adhesive microsphere by the membrane of a giant lipid vesicle and investigate the energetics and dynamics of the resulting neck structure. We find that neck formation occurs as a result of membrane shape energy minimization under the application of external force. Remarkably, increasing membrane tension could reopen the neck and reverse the wrapping process. This process shows a clear hysteresis and a degree of reversibility. Neck cleavage and particle detachment into the vesicle's interior could not be triggered in the range of our optical forces. Systematic studies on the thermal dynamics of wrapped particles allowed to establish that diffusion properties of the system are in agreement with a coupling of the particle motion with the neck structure, modeled as a solid inclusion within the membrane. Interestingly, the wrapped particle dynamics exhibited a tension dependency, which can be described as the sum of several drag contributions.",

This study investigates the dielectrophoretic (DEP) response and electro-mechanical deformation of cell nuclei interacting with active metallo-dielectric Janus Particles (JPs) under an externally applied electric field. An equivalent droplet two-phase model is employed to simulate the bioparticle, coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with the Phase Field Model to capture fluid motion and interface dynamics. Good qualitative agreement is obtained among experimental, analytical, and numerical results. The findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between nucleus deformation and its surface coverage of the JP with respect to the applied voltage. The overall coverage ratio of the JP dielectric hemisphere increases with voltage as the positive DEP force on the dielectric side strengthens, exhibiting maximum at a certain voltage. The strong correlation between nucleus flexibility and JP surface coverage suggests that the JP coverage ratio could serve as a biomechanical marker for nucleus deformability, providing a novel method for in-situ evaluation of nucleus mechanics.",

In the present study, microbiologically-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is used to manufacture laboratory-scale specimens for fracture toughness measurement. The mode I and mixed-mode fracture toughnesses are measured as a function of cementation, and are correlated with strength, permeability and porosity. A micromechanical model is developed to predict the dependence of mode I fracture toughness upon the degree of cementation. In addition, the role of the crack tip $T$-stress in dictating kink angle and toughness is determined for mixed mode loading. At a sufficiently low degree of cementation, the zone of microcracking in the vicinity of the crack tip is sufficiently large for a crack tip $K$-field to cease to exist and for crack kinking theory to not apply. The interplay between cementation and fracture properties of sedimentary rocks is explained; this understanding underpins a wide range of rock fracture phenomena including hydraulic fracture.",

Inspired by this principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair climbing.",

However, the scientific challenges for in developing icephobic surfaces have not been fully addressed because of degradation such as mechanical wearing. Inspired by the suppressed frost formation on concave regions of natural leaves, here we report findings on the frosting process on hydrophobic surfaces with various serrated structures. Dropwise condensation, the first stage of frosting, is enhanced on the peaks and suppressed in the valleys when the serrated surface is exposed to humid air, causing frosting to initiate from the peak. The condensed droplets in the valley are then evaporated due to the different equilibrium vapor pressure of ice and water, resulting in a non-frost band on both hydrophobic and superhydrophilic surfaces. The frost growth is systematically studied by employing various levels of ambient humidity, surface wettability, and surface geometry. Numerical simulations show the critical role of diffusion of water vapor in the formation of the discontinuous frost pattern.",

Specifically, we design a material where high-strength alumina bricks are interconnected via a ceria-stabilized zirconia mortar. As the design of such a material, driven by multiscale toughening mechanisms, requires a laborious trial-and-error approach, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework as an integral part of our methodology to streamline and accelerate the design process. We use a Gaussian process to emulate the material's mechanical response and implement a cost-aware batch Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal design process parameters, accounting for the cost of experimentally varying them. This approach expedites the optimization of the material's mechanical properties. As a result, we develop a bio-inspired all-ceramic composite that exhibits an exceptional balance between bending strength (704 MPa), and fracture toughness (13.6 MPa m^0.5).",

      "abstract": "The enhancement of power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of single-junction solar cells is a key objective in the advancement of hot carrier solar cells. Recent findings indicate that quantum wells (QWs) can effectively generate hot carriers by confining charged carriers within their potential wells and by optimizing material properties. Here, we investigate the impact of quantum confinement on the thermodynamic properties of photogenerated hot carriers in p-i-n InGaAs/InAlAs heterostructure diodes, utilizing QW thicknesses of 4 nm, 5.5 nm, and 7.5 nm. The optical properties of these nanostructures reveal significant hot carrier effects at various lattice temperatures, with a pronounced effect noted at lower temperatures. The experimental results indicate that the widest QW exhibits stronger hot carrier effects than the thinner QWs. Additionally, the open-circuit voltage of the samples demonstrates a correlation with the degree of quantum confinement, mirroring trends observed in the quasi-Fermi level splitting of hot carriers. However, the magnitudes recorded exceed the bandgap of the quantum structures, suggesting that this behavior may be influenced by the barrier layer. Furthermore, the short-circuit current of the samples reveals a strong dependence on excitation power, but not on the degree of quantum confinement. This indicates that the majority of the photocurrent is generated in the barrier, with negligible contributions from photogenerated carriers within the QWs. This study provides insights into the role of quantum confinement on the opto-electrical properties of non-equilibrium hot carrier populations in QW structures.",

      "abstract": "Despite extensive research on piezoelectric polymers since the discovery of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in 1969, the fundamental physics of polymer piezoelectricity has remained elusive. Based on the classic principle of piezoelectricity, polymer piezoelectricity should originate from the polar crystalline phase. Surprisingly, the crystal contribution to the piezoelectric strain coefficient d31 is determined to be less than 10%, primarily owing to the difficulty in changing the molecular bond lengths and bond angles. Instead, >85% contribution is from Poisson's ratio, which is closely related to the oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) in uniaxially stretched films of semicrystalline ferroelectric (FE) polymers. In this perspective, the semicrystalline structure-piezoelectric property relationship is revealed using PVDF-based FE polymers as a model system. In melt-processed FE polymers, the OAF is often present and links the crystalline lamellae to the isotropic amorphous fraction. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the electrostrictive conformation transformation of the OAF chains induces a polarization change upon the application of either a stress (the direct piezoelectric effect) or an electric field (the converse piezoelectric effect). Meanwhile, relaxor-like secondary crystals in OAF (SCOAF), which are favored to grow in the extended-chain crystal (ECC) structure, can further enhance the piezoelectricity. However, the ECC structure is difficult to achieve in PVDF homopolymers without high-pressure crystallization. We have discovered that high-power ultrasonication can effectively induce SCOAF in PVDF homopolymers to improve its piezoelectric performance. Finally, we envision that the electrostrictive OAF mechanism should also be applicable for other FE polymers such as odd-numbered nylons and piezoelectric biopolymers.",

This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \\gsm.   The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.   By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level.

      "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaic technologies. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\\text{OC}}$, texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.",

      "abstract": "Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.",

      "abstract": "Atomically thin two-dimensional materials such as graphene exhibit extremely high-pressure sensitivity compared to the commercially used pressure sensors due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent mechanical properties. The smaller piezoresistance of graphene across different transport regimes limits its pressure sensitivity compared to other two-dimensional materials. Using membrane theory and thin-film adhesivity model, we show miniaturization as means to enhance theoverall performance of graphene pressure sensors. Our findings reveal that ballistic graphene canbe configured to measure ultra-high pressure (10^9 Pa) with many-fold higher sensitivity per unit area than quasi-ballistic graphene, diffusive graphene, and thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Based on these findings, we propose an array of ballistic graphene sensors with extremely high-pressure sensitivity and ultra high-pressure range that will find applications in next-generation NEMS pressure sensors. The performance parameters of the array sensors can be further enhancedby reducing the size of graphene membranes and increasing the number of sensors in the array. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to explore similar applications using other two-dimensional materials.",

      "abstract": "Spintronic devices typically employ heterostructures with ferromagnets which break time-reversal symmetry and have non-vanishing magnetization. With the growing class of materials that support spin-polarized carriers, current, and excitations,it is possible to envision emerging spintronic applications that are not limited to magnetoresistance. Here we focus on chiral perovskites with no net magnetization where the space-inversion and mirror symmetries are broken to induce chiral structure. The known importance of these perovskites is further expanded by the demonstration of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, the generation of the spin-polarized carriers across the interface with these chiral perovskites remains to be fully understood. Our first-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites provide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis, which allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the underlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the Edelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a mechanism contributing to CISS. Furthermore, by examining optical properties of chiral perovskites and the opportunity to use them to realize tunable altermagnets, another class of zero-magnetization spintronic materials, we put forth a versatile materials platform for unconventional spintronics.",

      "abstract": "Safety and reliability are crucial for the public acceptance of autonomous driving. To ensure accurate and reliable environmental perception, intelligent vehicles must exhibit accuracy and robustness in various environments. Millimeter-wave radar, known for its high penetration capability, can operate effectively in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. Traditional 3D millimeter-wave radars can only provide range, Doppler, and azimuth information for objects. Although the recent emergence of 4D millimeter-wave radars has added elevation resolution, the radar point clouds remain sparse due to Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) operations. In contrast, cameras offer rich semantic details but are sensitive to lighting and weather conditions. Hence, this paper leverages these two highly complementary and cost-effective sensors, 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera. By integrating 4D radar spectra with depth-aware camera images and employing attention mechanisms, we fuse texture-rich images with depth-rich radar data in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective, enhancing 3D object detection. Additionally, we propose using GAN-based networks to generate depth images from radar spectra in the absence of depth sensors, further improving detection accuracy.",

Here, we describe an analytical tool based on quantum sensing techniques. We magnetically coupled negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) with nitroxide radicals present in a bioinert polymer coating of the NDs. We demonstrated that the T1 spin relaxation time of NV centers is very sensitive to the number of nitroxide radicals, with a resolution down to ~10 spins per ND (detection of approximately $ 10^-23 $ mol in a localized volume). The detection is based on T1 shortening upon the radical attachment and we propose a theoretical model describing this phenomenon. We further show this colloidally stable, water-soluble system can be used dynamically for spatiotemporal readout of a redox chemical process (oxidation of ascorbic acid) occurring near the ND surface in an aqueous environment under ambient conditions.",

      "abstract": "Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.",

They are important in many scientific and engineering applications due to their tunable physiochemical properties, bio-compatibility, and ultra-low friction. Their multiphase structure leads to a complex interfacial rheology, yet a detailed, microscopic understanding of hydrogel friction is still emerging. Using a custom-built tribometer, here we identify three distinct regimes of frictional behavior for polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyacrylamide (PAAm), and agarose hydrogel spheres on smooth surfaces. We find that at low velocities, friction is controlled by hydrodynamic flow through the porous hydrogel network, and is inversely proportional to the characteristic pore size. At high velocities, a mesoscopic, lubricating liquid film forms between the gel and surface that obeys elastohydrodynamic theory. Between these regimes, the frictional force decreases by an order of magnitude and displays slow relaxation over several minutes. Our results can be interpreted as an interfacial shear thinning of the polymers with an increasing relaxation time due to the confinement of entanglements. This transition can be tuned by varying the solvent salt concentration, solvent viscosity, and sliding geometry at the interface.",

Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.",

However, dislocation engineering has frequently been deemed uncommon in ceramics owing to the brittle nature of ceramics. Contradicting this conventional view, various approaches have been used to introduce dislocations into ceramic materials without crack formation, thereby paving the way for controlled ceramics performance. However, the influence of dislocations on functional properties is equally complicated owing to the intricate structure of ceramic materials. Furthermore, despite numerous experiments and simulations investigating dislocation-controlled properties in ceramics, comprehensive reviews summarizing the effects of dislocations on ceramics are still lacking. This review focuses on some representative dislocation-controlled properties of ceramic materials, including mechanical and some key functional properties, such as transport, ferroelectricity, thermal conductivity, and superconducting properties. A brief integration of dislocations in ceramic is anticipated to offer new insights for the advancement of dislocation engineering across various disciplines.",

      "abstract": "Constructing precise micro-nano metal patterns on complex three-dimensional (3D) plastic parts allows the fabrication of functional devices for advanced applications. However, this patterning is currently expensive and requires complex processes with long manufacturing lead time. The present work demonstrates a process for the fabrication of micro-nano 3D metal-plastic composite structures with arbitrarily complex shapes. In this approach, a light-cured resin is modified to prepare an active precursor capable of allowing subsequent electroless plating (ELP). A multi-material digital light processing 3D printer was newly developed to enable the fabrication of parts containing regions made of either standard resin or active precursor resin nested within each other. Selective 3D ELP processing of such parts provided various metal-plastic composite parts having complicated hollow micro-nano structures with specific topological relationships on a size scale as small as 40 um. Using this technique, 3D metal topologies that cannot be manufactured by traditional methods are possible, and metal patterns can be produced inside plastic parts as a means of further miniaturizing electronic devices. The proposed method can also generate metal coatings exhibiting improved adhesion of metal to plastic substrate. Based on this technique, several sensors composed of different functional nonmetallic materials and specific metal patterns were designed and fabricated. The present results demonstrate the viability of the proposed method and suggest potential applications in the fields of smart 3D micro-nano electronics, 3D wearable devices, micro/nano-sensors, and health care.",

While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.",

However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.",

      "abstract": "Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.",

      "abstract": "Architected materials that harness elastic snap-through buckling can trap energy reversibly. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit excellent dissipation capabilities due to polymer network viscoelasticity and rate-dependent soft stress behavior associated with mesogen rotation. Incorporating LCEs into buckling lattice structures enhances energy absorption; however, conventional design cannot take advantage of the dissipation mechanism associated with mesogen rotation because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold of the soft stress response. In this study, we investigate tension-induced mesogen rotation as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic user-defined element was implemented in Abaqus/Standard to capture finite-strain behavior, including soft stress effects. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. Energy contributions from mesogen rotation and polymer network viscoelasticity were quantified. These findings inform the design strategies for LCE-based architected materials to enhance dissipation.",

Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.",

Recently, marker-based VBTSs have been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras. \\uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface; and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs. Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.",

      "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in wireless smart implants over the last two decades, current implantable devices still operate passively and require additional electronic modules for wireless transmission of the stored biological data. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative wireless force sensing paradigm for implantable systems through the integration of mechanical metamaterials and nano energy harvesting technologies. We demonstrate composite mechanical metamaterial implants capable of serving as all-in-one wireless force sensing units, incorporating functions for power generation, sensing and transmission with ultra-low power requirements. In this alternative communication approach, the electrical signals harvested by the implants from mechanical stimuli are utilized directly for the wireless transmission of the sensed data. We conduct experimental and theoretical studies to demonstrate the wireless detection of the generated strain-induced polarization electric field using electrodes. The feasibility of the proposed wireless force sensing approach is evaluated through a proof-of-concept orthopedic implant in the form of a total knee replacement. The findings indicate that the created wireless, electronic-free metamaterial implants with a power output as low as 0.1 picowatts enable direct, self-powered wireless communication during force sensing across air, simulated body fluid and animal tissue. We validate the functionality of the proposed implants through a series of experiments conducted on an ex vivo human cadaver knee specimen. Furthermore, the effect of electrode size and placement on the strength of the received signals is examined. Finally, we highlight the potential of our approach to create a diverse array of mechanically-tunable wireless force sensing implants without relying on any external power sources.",

The dynamics of metamaterials are particularly fascinating, promising the capability to guide, attenuate, and focus waves at will. Phononic metamaterials aim to manipulate mechanical waves with broad applications in acoustics, elastodynamics, and structural vibrations. A key bottleneck in the advancement of phononic metamaterials is scalability -- in design, simulation, and especially fabrication (e.g., beyond tens of unit cells per spatial dimension). We present a framework for scalable inverse design of spatially graded metamaterials for elastic wave guiding, together with a scalable microfabrication method. This framework enables the design and realization of complex waveguides including hundreds of thousands of unit cells, with the potential to extend to millions with no change in protocol. Scalable design is achieved via optimization with a ray tracing model for waves in spatially graded beam lattices. Designs are fabricated by photolithography and etching of silicon wafers to create free-standing microarchitected films. Wave guiding is demonstrated experimentally, using pulsed laser excitation and an interferometer for displacement measurements. Broadband wave guiding is demonstrated, indicating the promise of our scalable design and fabrication methods for on-chip elastic wave manipulation.",

This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the impact of surface functionalization on heat transfer at the silica/water interface. It has been shown that the surface functionalization changes significantly the wetting characteristics of silica surface: from one hand hydroxyl groups render such surfaces more hydrophilic, while methyl groups more hydrophobic. Here, we reveal that modifying the surface functionalization from methylated to hydroxylated groups results in: (i) up to an approximately eightfold increase in adhesion energy, (ii) a reorientation of interfacial water molecules to align perpendicular to the surface normal, (iii) a reduction in the liquid depletion length near the interface, and (iv) an overall enhancement of interfacial heat conduction. We quantify interfacial thermal resistance through the calculation of the contribution of each functional group to the total heat flux, providing insights into the physical mechanisms governing heat transfer at functionalized interfaces. We demonstrated that manipulation of the concentrations of the functional groups can be used to tailor interfacial thermal transport.",

      "title": "Adhesive forces inhibit underwater contact formation for a soft-hard   collision",
      "abstract": "Thermodynamics tells us to expect underwater contact between two hydrophobic surfaces to result in stronger adhesion compared to two hydrophilic surfaces. However, presence of water changes not only energetics, but also the dynamic process of reaching a final state, which couples solid deformation and liquid evacuation. These dynamics can create challenges for achieving strong underwater adhesion/friction, which affects diverse fields including soft robotics, bio-locomotion and tire traction. Closer investigation, requiring sufficiently precise resolution of film evacuation while simultaneously controlling surface wettability has been lacking. We perform high resolution in-situ frustrated total internal reflection imaging to track underwater contact evolution between soft-elastic hemispheres of varying stiffness and smooth-hard surfaces of varying wettability. Surprisingly, we find exponential rate of water evacuation from hydrophobic-hydrophobic (adhesive) contact is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that from hydrophobic-hydrophilic (non-adhesive) contact. The trend of decreasing rate with decreasing wettability of glass sharply changes about a point where thermodynamic adhesion crosses zero, suggesting a transition in mode of evacuation, which is illuminated by 3-Dimensional spatiotemporal heightmaps. Adhesive contact is characterized by the early localization of sealed puddles, whereas non-adhesive contact remains smooth, with film-wise evacuation from one central puddle. Measurements with a human thumb and alternatively hydrophobic/hydrophilic glass surface demonstrate practical consequences of the same dynamics: adhesive interactions cause instability in valleys and lead to a state of more trapped water and less intimate solid-solid contact.",

      "abstract": "Optical tweezers equipped with position detection allow for application of piconewton-scale forces and high-temporal-resolution measurements of nanometer-scale motion. While typically used for trapping microscopic objects, the optical tweezer detection pathway can also be used for a microscopy technique sensitive to nanometer-sized structures. Optical tweezers most commonly use back-focal-plane detection to determine the position of the trapped object. This technique involves analyzing the interference pattern between scattered and unscattered light. Despite the reliance on interference, we show that an image of an extended object can be understood as a sum of the images of individual point-like particles that make up the object. This allows for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane detection to be used as an imaging tool capable of determining the mass distribution of scanned structures. Furthermore, the sample-orientation-dependent detector response allows for a unique method of background subtraction. We demonstrate the quantitative imaging capabilities of optical tweezer microscopy by determining the size distributions multiple nearby particles and measuring the changing diameter of collagen fibrils. The background subtraction technique is demonstrated by imaging surface-bound microtubules with a strong background from protein aggregate co-adsorption. Optical tweezer microscopy allows for quantitative imaging of objects far from the coverslip surface. This makes it an excellent tool for studying the link between the structure and mechanics of microscopic systems.",

      "abstract": "The exceptional adhesion properties of biological fibrillar structures -- such as those found in geckos -- have inspired the development of synthetic adhesive surfaces. Among these, mushroom-shaped fibrils have demonstrated superior pull-off strength compared to other geometries. In this study, we employ a computational approach based on a Dugdale cohesive zone model to analyze the detachment behavior of these fibrils when adhered to a rigid substrate. The results provide complete pull-off curves, revealing that the separation process is inherently unstable under load control, regardless of whether detachment initiates at the fibril edge or center. Our findings show that fibrils with a wide, thin mushroom cap effectively reduce stress concentrations and promote central detachment, leading to enhanced adhesion. However, detachment from the center is not observed in all geometries, whereas edge detachment can occur under certain conditions in all cases. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adhesion defects at the fibril center, showing that they can significantly reduce pull-off strength, particularly at high values of the dimensionless parameter \\c{hi}. These insights contribute to the optimization of bio-inspired adhesives and microstructured surfaces for various engineering applications.",

Here, we report an original low-temperature epitaxial method for growth of site-controlled in-plane germanium nanowires with high hole mobility by molecular beam epitaxy. By reducing the growth temperature, we effectively suppress Si-Ge interdiffusion, ensuring pure germanium composition within the nanowires while preserving their high crystalline quality. The method employs pre-patterned ridges on strain-relaxed Si$_{0.75}$Ge$_{0.25}$/Si(001) substrates as tailored templates, enabling control over the position, length, spacing and cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. Electrical measurements of field-effect devices made from as-grown germanium nanowires show that the nanowires are of hole conduction with mobility exceeding 7000 cm$^{2}$/Vs at 2-20 K. The method paves a way for fabrication of scalable germanium nanowire networks, providing a reliable platform for the developments of high-performance nanoelectronics and multi-qubit chips.",

      "abstract": "Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.",

      "abstract": "Dense liquids gradually transform into non-equilibrium amorphous solids as they pass through the experimental glass transition. Experimentally, ergodicity is lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More than seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments could run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an ergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions represent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously established in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and several idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding in finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical limitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative Kauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing a computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to access the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic glass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This enables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that provide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at a temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is towards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a hierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first demonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical mechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state. We anticipate that our study will serve as a foundation for future simulation work on larger systems, three-dimensional materials, and more complex glass-forming models to fully elucidate the nature of the glass state of matter.",

      "abstract": "A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.",

We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the N\\'eel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.",

Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.",

The substrate and indenter surfaces are either bare or graphene-covered. Our simulations show that the influence of the adhesion between the bare substrate and indenter tip can be significantly reduced by decreasing the adhesion strength and adhesion range between the atoms on the substrate and indenter, or by enhancing the substrate stiffness. Our results suggest that the elastic response of the substrate exhibits weaker adhesion after the coating of graphene layers on either side of the contacting interface, which is attributed to the weak interaction between the graphene layers. Based on these principles obtained for the bare substrate, the nanoscale contact behavior of the substrate can be tuned into a near-ideal Hertzian state by increasing the number of graphene layers, applying pre-strains to graphene on substrate, or using large indenters. Our research provides theoretical guidance for designing adhesion-less coatings for AFM probes and MEMS/NEMS systems.",

To develop the method, we investigate in detail the mechanical interactions between the AFM tip and a stretched, free-standing thin film sample. Our findings reveal the conditions to avoid artifacts related to sample bending modes or resonant excitations. As an example, we analyze strain effects in thin gold films deposited on a soft silicone substrate. Our technique allows to observe the details of microcrack opening during tensile strain and their impact on local current transport and surface mechanics. We find that although the film fractures into separate fragments, at higher strain a current transport is sustained by a tunneling mechanism. The microscopic observation of local defect formation and their correlation to local conductivity will provide novel insight to design more robust and fatigue resistant stretchable conductors.",

In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.",

      "abstract": "Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.",

While gene upregulation via transcriptional activators has been extensively investigated, gene silencing remains understudied, especially by modelling. This study employs 3D simulations to study the biophysics of a chromatin fibre where active transcription factors compete with repressors for binding to transcription units along the fibre, and investigates how different silencing mechanisms affect 3D chromatin structure and transcription. We examine three gene silencing feedback mechanisms: positive, negative, and neutral. These mechanisms capture different silencing pathways observed or proposed in biological systems. Our findings reveal that, whilst all mechanisms lead to a silencing transition, the signatures of this transition depend on the choice of the feedback. The latter controls the morphologies of the emergent 3D transcription factor clusters, the average gene expression and its variability, or gene noise, and the network of ensuing correlations between activities of neighbouring transcription units. These results provide insights into the biophysics of gene silencing, as well as into the interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organisation.",

      "abstract": "How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.",

      "abstract": "Wave mode conversion allows to transform energy from one propagating wave type to another at a boundary where a change in material properties or geometry occurs. Converting longitudinal waves to flexural ones is of particular interest in elasticity due to their significant displacement amplitudes, facilitating detection at the surface for practical applications. Typically, the design of wave conversion devices requires (i) the use of locally resonant structures with a spacing much shorter than the associated wavelengths, or (ii) architected media whose effective properties yield efficient mode conversion at selected frequencies. In both cases, the realization of these devices may incur in fabrication difficulties, thus requiring alternative solutions based on simpler designs that can retain the wave manipulation capabilities of interest. In this paper, we propose the use of single-phase periodically undulated beams to design phononic crystals that achieve wave mode conversion between longitudinal and flexural waves. We derive the corresponding dispersion relations using the plane wave expansion method and demonstrate that the coupling between longitudinal and flexural wave modes can be manipulated using an undulated profile, generating mode veering with inverted group velocities. The wave conversion mechanism is verified both computationally and experimentally, showing good agreement. Our findings indicate a versatile design strategy for phononic crystals with efficient wave conversion property, enabling applications in structural health monitoring, sensing, and non-destructive testing.",

Derived from the Zwanzig projection operator formalism, our approach introduces a spatiotemporal kernel function of heat conduction, which governs the spatiotemporal response of the local heat flux in nonuniform media to surrounding temperature gradients while incorporating temporal memory effects. Our statistical analysis shows that memory, nonlocality, and interfacial temperature discontinuities emerge naturally from the microscopic coupling between two classes of irrelevant degrees of freedom: flux mode and nonlocal mode variables. Although these irrelevant variables are not directly observable at the macroscopic level, their integrated influence on the heat flux is fully encoded in the kernel function. In the diffusive limit, the kernel recovers and generalizes Fourier law by replacing the thermal conductivity with an infinite hierarchy of position dependent higher order tensors that capture nanoscale nonlocality. We also outline atomistic strategies for computing the spatiotemporal kernel in various classes of material media, enabling predictive modeling of heat transport in structurally complex and compositionally inhomogeneous systems. These include nanostructured, anisotropic, and interfacial materials where classical local models break down. Finally, the kernel function formalism is extensible to electronic, spin, or magnetic systems, providing a broadly applicable platform for next generation transport theory at ultrafast and nanoscale regimes.",

      "abstract": "Foot trajectory planning for dry adhesion legged climbing robots presents challenges, as the phases of foot detachment, swing, and adhesion significantly influence the adhesion and detachment forces essential for stable climbing. To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \\%, vibration amplitude by 82 \\%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.",

The lattices are mostly buckled but flat for a handful of elements such as Na, K, Rb, Ag, Au, and Cd, depending on physisorption strength. Moreover, under certain conditions, the structure can be controlled by applying biaxial tensile stress parallel or an electric field normal to the surface. The stress reduces the threshold of adhesion strength required to flatten a buckled lattice, and the electric field can be used to increase that threshold controllably. Our results help provide fundamental information about the structures of physisorbed metallenes and suggest means to control them at will by suitable substrate choice or tuning of experimental parameters.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review and tutorial on multi-functional metasurfaces integrated with M-type ferrite materials for millimeter-wave (mmWave) absorption and beam control. As wireless communication systems transition toward beyond-5G architectures, including non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), the demand for adaptive, low-profile electromagnetic surfaces that can manage interference while enabling beam reconfiguration becomes increasingly critical. Conventional metasurfaces often struggle to simultaneously achieve high absorption and beamforming over wide frequency ranges due to intrinsic material and structural limitations. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in metasurface design for dual-functionality, particularly those combining frequency-selective magnetic materials with periodic surface lattices, to enable passive, compact, and reconfigurable reflectors and absorbers. Special emphasis is placed on the role of M-type ferrites in enhancing absorption via ferromagnetic resonance, and on the use of surface-wave trapping mechanisms to achieve narrowband and broadband functionality. A case study of a ferrite-based hybrid \"reflectsorber\" (reflectorarray + absorber) is presented to demonstrate key design concepts, analytical models, and application scenarios relevant to satellite, UAV, and NTN ground station deployments. Future directions for low-loss, tunable, and scalable metasurfaces in next-generation wireless infrastructures are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing demand for personalized health monitoring, wearable sensors have gained attention in medical diagnostics and physiological tracking. Hydrogels, known for their mechanical properties and similarity to biological tissues, are ideal for flexible sensing. However, conventional hydrogels face challenges in stability, biocompatibility, adhesion, and long-term comfort, especially in dynamic conditions.This study presents a highly sensitive, self-adhesive, and biocompatible organohydrogel fabricated via DLP 3D printing. By integrating an entanglement-dominated crosslinking mechanism with chemical and physical crosslinking, the hydrogel achieves high elasticity, mechanical strength, and durability. Methacrylic anhydride-grafted \\k{appa}-carrageenan serves as the primary network, with optimized grafting rates enhancing tensile properties and strain modulation. The copolymer network of MA-kappa-CA and ACMO benefits from steric hindrance effects, improving swelling integrity and long-term stability.Experimental results confirm sustained adhesion and structural integrity under prolonged skin exposure, making it suitable for extended wear. The hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile resilience, flexibility, and strain-sensing capabilities. In vitro studies validate its biocompatibility, supporting its biomedical potential. Furthermore, its integration into wearable smart devices demonstrates promise for cervical spine monitoring and sports rehabilitation. A CNN-based system enables real-time, multi-channel analysis of cervical motion, proving its viability as a high-sensitivity flexible sensor for health monitoring and injury prevention.The proposed DLP 3D-printed hydrogel offers significant applications in flexible electronics, wearable sensors, and biomedical technologies, paving the way for next-generation health-monitoring systems.",

Here, we show that specific, but promiscuous, short-range binding interactions make it possible to economically assemble linear filaments of user-defined length. Our approach leads to independent control over the mean and width of the filament size distribution and allows us to smoothly explore design trade-offs between assembly quality (spread in size) and cost (number of particle species). We employ a simple hierarchical assembly protocol to minimize assembly times, and show that multiple stages of hierarchy make it possible to extend our approach to the assembly of higher-dimensional structures. Our work provides a simple and experimentally straightforward solution to size control that is immediately applicable to a broad range of systems, from DNA origami assemblies to supramolecular polymers and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Optical tweezers can confine position as well as orientation of a Brownian particle by simultaneously exerting restoring force and torque on it. Here we have proposed the theoretical model of a microscopic Stirling engine, using a passive Brownian ellipsoid as its working substance. The position and the orientation degrees of freedom (DoF) of the ellipsoid in two dimensions (2D), both being confined harmonically by the tweezers, are coupled to a hot and a cold thermal bath time-periodically. The stiffness of the force confinement is also time-periodic such that it resembles a piston-like protocol which drives the Brownian ellipsoid through the strokes of a Stirling cycle. The ellipsoid takes heat from the hot bath and partially converts it into useful thermodynamic work. The extracted work and input heat shows explicit dependence on the shape of the working substance as well as its orientational bias. The operational characteristics of the anisotropic Stirling engine is analyzed using the variance in work and efficiency (in the quasi-static regime), where the latter is bounded by both the Carnot limit as well as the isotropic benchmark. Several ways have been proposed to yield maximum efficiency at a minimum fluctuation in the output. The dissipative coupling between the position and orientation of the ellipsoid, that arises due to its spherical-asymmetry (or, shape anisotropy) and a finite mean orientation, plays an important role to optimize the engine characteristics. Finally, we have analytically explored the slightly anisotropic regime, where the coupling is linearized by suitably tuning the system parameters. The average extracted work has also been calculated in this case, which shows an excellent agreement with the numerical results of the fully anisotropic system, when subjected to the stipulated range of parameters.",

This phenomenon is attributed to a new mechanism referred to as dynamic plastic deformation delocalization, which opens a new design space for enhancing the mechanical performance of metallic materials. We demonstrate that the activation of this mechanism has a significant impact on fatigue properties, greatly enhancing fatigue strength when it occurs.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a simple and cost-effective broadband self-decoupling mechanism to mitigate strong mutual coupling in tightly stacked patch antenna pairs. Unlike conventional decoupling approaches that rely on oppositely directed surface currents between parasitic and driven patches, the proposed method achieves broadband self-decoupling under co-directional surface current distributions by introducing an embedded ultra-narrow metallic coupling line between adjacent parasitic patches. This design effectively mitigates boresight gain reduction and total efficiency degradation typically introduced by conventional decoupling techniques, without requiring additional decoupling circuits or complex fabrication processes. In a tightly spaced two-element array, the proposed method enhances isolation by 16.9 dB across the 5G NR N78 band, reaching a maximum improvement of 40.2 dB. It also supports compact adjacent-band MIMO systems, maintaining mutual coupling levels below -20 dB for antennas operating across both the N77 and N78 bands. Experimental validation on three representative configurations confirms the broadband self-decoupling capability and practical applicability of the proposed technique.",

      "abstract": "Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we uncover a \"detectability-durability trade-off\", demonstrating a tension between a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off, explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of natural swarm dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Enhancing light-matter interactions on a chip is of paramount importance to study nano- and quantum optics effects and to realise integrated devices, for instance, for classical and quantum photonics, sensing and energy harvesting applications. Engineered nano-devices enable the efficient confinement of light and the control of the spontaneous emission dynamics of single emitters, which is crucial for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments and for the development of classical and quantum light sources. Here, we report on the demonstration of enhanced light-matter interaction and Purcell effects on a chip, based on bio-inspired aperiodic devices fabricated in silicon nitride and gallium arsenide. Internal light sources, namely optically-active defect centers in silicon nitride and indium arsenide single quantum dots, are used to image and characterize, by means of micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, the individual optical modes confined by photonic membranes with Vogel-spiral geometry. By studying the statistics of the measured optical resonances, in partnership with rigorous multiple scattering theory, we observe log-normal distributions and report quality factors with values as high as 2201+/-443. Building on the strong light confinement achieved in this novel platform, we further investigate the coupling of single semiconductor quantum dots to the confined optical modes. Our results show cavity quantum electrodynamics effects providing strong modifications of the spontaneous emission decay of single optical transitions: we show control of the decay lifetime of single emitters with a dynamic range reaching 20. Our findings improve the understanding of the fundamental physical properties of light-emitting Vogel-spiral systems, show their application to quantum photonic devices, and form the basis for the further development of classical and quantum active devices on a chip.",

Additionally, we discuss the applicable conditions of this new method. The proposed technique allows measurements in atmospheric conditions and is, in principle, applicable to all types of nanolayers and substrates.

By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.",

The curing adhesive composites were produced by a scalable technique with a mixture of single-layer and few-layer graphene layers of a few-micron lateral dimensions. It was found that the electromagnetic transmission, T, is low even at small concentrations of graphene fillers: T<1% at frequency of 300 GHz for a composite with only 1 wt% of graphene. The main shielding mechanism in composites with the low graphene loading is absorption. The composites of 1 mm thickness and graphene loading of 8 wt% provide excellent electromagnetic shielding of 70 dB in the sub-terahertz EHF frequency with negligible energy reflection to the environment.

      "abstract": "Complex flow fields govern the deformation of polymers in various manufacturing processes. However, high flow rates may trigger reaction events (i.e., bond breaking or undesirable reaction of mechanophores) in raw polymeric materials, leading to the mechanical or functional debasement of manufactured structures. Additionally, it is difficult to fully characterize such molecular-level flow in the laboratory due to time- and length-scale limits. In this study, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to explore the rheological and mechanical degradation of unentangled polymer melts under uniaxial extensional flow (UEF), allowing for chain breaking. Our simulations demonstrate shear thickening-thinning-thickening stages with the increase of UEF extension rates, resulting from flow-induced changes of chain conformation. With further increasing UEF extension rates, a bond-breaking potential leads to another flow thinning stage. Interestingly, fracture kinetics is originally first-order owing to the need for highly stretched polymer chains before bond fracture. It is no longer first-order when bond fracture is instigated before chains are stretched. Our computational work provides insight into the optimal design of the manufacturing process for polymeric materials.",

      "abstract": "Brownian Information engine (BIE) harnesses the energy from a fluctuating environment by utilizing the associated information change in the presence of a single heat bath. The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential and requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the feedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and relaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential energy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of information (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy output. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired information is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss during relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net (available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback controller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore the effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have multiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information and, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback protocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the amount of maximum work output under different potential profiling. For monostable trapping, a concave shape in confining potential results in a higher work output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the confining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An appropriate shape modulation can create a heater-refrigerator transition and their reentrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the relaxation process.",

In view of potential applications to \\b{eta}-Ga2O3-based heterostructure, we performed atomistic modelling of (InxAl1-x)2O3 alloys using density functional theory to investigate thermodynamic and electrical properties of conventional group IV dopants (Si, Sn, C, Ge), alternative metal donors (Ta, Zr, Hf), and acceptors (Mg, Zn, Cu). The hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof functional (HSE06) is used to accurately quantify the defect formation energies, ionization levels, and concentrations over a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions for the oxygen chemical potential and temperature. In our atomistic models, Hf and Zr show favourable properties as alternative donors to Si and other group IV impurities, especially under oxygen-poor conditions. Our findings also suggest that acceptors Mg, Zn, and Cu, while they cannot promote p-doping, can be still beneficial for the compensation of unintentionally n-doped materials, e.g., to generate semi-insulating layers and improve rectification.",

      "title": "Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the   electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors",
      "abstract": "The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.",

      "abstract": "The mid-infrared region is crucial for elucidating the unique biochemical signatures of microorganisms. The MIR resonant structures turned out to facilitate exceptional performance owing to the enhance electric field confinement in the nano-sized aperture. However, the extension of such technique in bacteria-sensing remains limited, primarily due to its micrometre size. This work is the first demonstration of a MIR resonant structure, the gold-coated micro-structured inverted pyramid array of silicon exhibiting light-trapping capabilities, for the bacteria detection in entire MIR range. The electric-field localization within the micro-sized cavity of inverted pyramid amplifies the light-matter interaction by harnessing surface plasmon polaritons, leading to improved detection sensitivity. The confinement of electric field is further corroborated by electric-field simulations based on finite element method. In particular, we observed notable enhancement in both the quantitative and qualitative detection of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus for the bacteria cell with very low concentration, reflecting the efficacy of our detection method. Furthermore, the cost-effective micro structured silicon is fabricated using metal-assisted chemical etching method with the lithography-free method, along with the capabilities of wafer-scale fabrication. Moreover, our device configuration even demonstrates the characteristics of reusability and reproducibility offers substantial benefits over conventional detection schemes. Consequently, this CMOS technology-compatible biosensor signifies promising ways for the integration of this technology with forthcoming bio-applications.",

Enhancing these materials with additional functions might expand their range of multidisciplinary applications. Here, we demonstrate the temperature sensing potential of SU8-Phenylenediamine (SU8-mPD), which was produced by epoxy amination of the SU-8 polymer. The SU8-mPD properties were examined through a series of molecular structural techniques and optical methods. Thin layers have demonstrated optical emission and absorption in the visible range around 420 and 520 nm respectively alongside a strong thermal responsivity, characterized by the 18 ppm\\cdotK-1 expansion coefficient. A photonic chip, comprising a thin 5-10 {\\mu}m SU8-mPD layer, encased between parallel silver and/or gold thin film mirrors, has been fabricated. This assembly, when pumped by an external light source, generates a pronounced fluorescent signal which is superimposed with the Fabry-P\\'erot (FP) resonant response. The chip undergoes mechanical deformation in response to temperature changes, thereby shifting the FP resonance and encoding temperature information into the fluorescence output spectrum. The time response of the device was estimated to be below 500 msec opening a new avenue for optical sensing using SU8-based polymers. Thermoresponsive resonant structures, encompassing strong tunable fluorescent properties, can further enrich the functionalities of nanophotonic polymer-based platforms.",

Photonic nanostructures, in our case SCD nanopillars on thin (< 1$\\mu$m) platforms, are highly relevant for nanoscale sensing. The presented top-down procedure includes electron beam lithography (EBL) as well as reactive ion etching (RIE). Our method introduces a novel type of inter-layer, namely silicon, that significantly enhances the adhesion of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) electron beam resist to SCD and avoids sample charging during EBL. In contrast to previously used adhesion layers, our silicon layer can be removed using a highly-selective RIE step which is not damaging HSQ mask structures. We thus refine published nanofabrication processes to ease a higher process reliability especially in the light of the advancing commercialization of SCD sensor devices.",

      "abstract": "The work dissipated in pulling a polymer chain with internal friction is numerically calculated by considering a sequence of $N$ bead-spring-dashpots tethered at one end and being pulled at the other using a harmonic trap via linear and symmetric protocols. The variation of the dissipation with the chain length, pulling trap stiffness, and the internal friction parameter are examined in detail for both the protocols. In the limit of high trap stiffness: (i) the dissipation $decreases$ with $N$ for chains with internal friction, keeping all other parameters constant, and (ii) the relationship between the dissipation and internal friction parameter deviates from linearity as $N$ is increased. Consequently, a closed-form expression between the dissipated work in driving a chain of spring-dashpots and the damping coefficient of a single dashpot can be written only for the case of $N = 1$ [as shown in Phys.

To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.",

We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm, we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward targeted applications and robust validation.",

      "abstract": "Widely available vegetable oils were readily derivatized into chemically pure ABn-type monomers (n = 2 or 3). Their polymerization led to unprecedented hyperbranched polyesters. Four different AB2/AB3-type monomers bearing one A-type methyl ester and two or three B-type alcohol functions were purposely synthesized via two elementary steps, i.e. epoxidation of the internal double bond of the vegetable oil precursors followed by ring-opening of the epoxy groups under acidic conditions. The polycondensation of these bio-sourced monomers was performed in bulk, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, giving access to modular hyperbranched polyesters with tunable properties. Among the catalysts tested, zinc acetate, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) and sodium methoxide proved the most effective, allowing the achievement of molar masses in the range 3000--10 000 g mol--1 and dispersities varying from 2 to 15, depending on the initial conditions. The degree of branching, DB, as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, was found to be between 0.07 and 0.45. The as-devised hyperbranched polyesters displayed either amorphous or semi-crystalline properties, as a function of the selected AB2/AB3-type initial monomers, with a glass transition temperature, Tg, ranging from --33 to 9 {\\textdegree}C and a decomposition temperature at 5 wt% of the sample, Td5%, varying from 204 to 340 {\\textdegree}C.",

      "abstract": "The collective chemotaxis of multicellular clusters is an important phenomenon in various physiological contexts, ranging from embryonic development to cancer metastasis. Such clusters often display interesting shape dynamics and instabilities, but their physical origin, functional benefits, and role in overall chemotactic migration remain unclear. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental observations of malignant lymphocyte cluster migration in vitro to understand how these dynamics arise from an interplay of chemotactic response and inter-cellular interactions. Our cell-based computational model incorporates active propulsion of cells, contact inhibition of locomotion, chemoattractant response, as well as alignment, adhesive, and exclusion interactions between cells. We find that clusters remain fluid and maintain cohesive forward migration in low chemoattractant gradients. However, above a threshold gradient, clusters display an instability driven by local cluster-shape dependent velocity differentials that causes them to elongate perpendicular to the gradient and eventually break apart. Comparison with our in vitro data shows the predicted transition to the cluster instability regime with increased gradient, as well as quantitative agreement with key features such as cluster aspect ratio, orientation, and breaking frequency. This instability naturally limits the size of multicellular aggregates, and, in addition, clusters in the instability regime display optimal forward migration speeds, suggesting functional implications in vivo. Our work provides valuable insights into generic instabilities of chemotactic clusters, elucidates physical factors that could contribute to metastatic spreading, and can be extended to other living or synthetic systems of active clusters.",

      "abstract": "In polymer solutions, the phenomenon of cononsolvency describes when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for the polymer over some specific composition range. Observations of cononsolvency typically relate to either phase separation at the macroscopic level or chain collapse at the microscopic level. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between the macroscopic and microscopic observations of cononsolvency and how these differ by mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we distinguish between different mechanisms of cononsolvency using various models and observations derived from a single theoretical framework for polymer solutions. We first use mean-field analysis to identify energetic regimes, which are defined by sets of effective $\\chi$ parameters, where changes in solvent/cosolvent composition induce phase separation. Next, to make a connection to the microscopic physics, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations of models with interactions that align with these effective $\\chi$ parameters from these different regimes and observe corresponding composition-induced coil-globule transitions. These transitions are elucidated with signatures associated with specific mechanisms of cononsolvency from the literature. Interestingly, systems with identical effective $\\chi$ parameters can display different mechanisms at the microscopic level. Ultimately, these results provide new insights into cononsolvency that may help to distinguish amongst mechanisms or inform strategies to control polymer solution behavior.",

It is the tendency (found in all incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic solids) exhibited by a soft block to expand vertically when sheared horizontally. It can be observed whenever the length of the cuboid is at least four times its thickness. Here we show that the Poynting effect can be easily reversed and the cuboid can shrink vertically, simply by reducing this aspect ratio. In principle, this discovery means that for a given solid, say one used as a seismic wave absorber under a building, an optimal ratio exists where vertical displacements and vibrations can be completely eliminated. Here we first recall the classical theoretical treatment of the positive Poynting effect, and then show experimentally how it can be reversed. Using Finite Element simulations, we then investigate how the effect can be suppressed. We find that cubes always provide a reverse Poynting effect, irrespective of their material properties (in the third-order theory of weakly nonlinear elasticity).",

Furthermore, heterostructures consisting of TMDs with metals, oxides, and conductive materials have attracted significant research interest due to their exceptional electronic properties. In this study, we utilized density functional theory to investigate those electronic and transport properties, which are relevant for the application of tribo-piezoelectricity in creating novel nanogenerators: an interdisciplinary approach with promising implications. The results of the study demonstrate that the enhancement of charge transfer between layers and the orbital contribution to the Fermi level under applied strain in MoS/IrO, MoS/TiO, MoS/WTe, and MoTe/WS heterostructures is noteworthy. Additionally, non-equilibrium Green's function calculations of electron transport properties provide valuable insights into the behavior of these materials under different conditions. While MoS/IrO and MoS/TiO hetero-bilayers are unsuitable due to their tendency to exhibit large current flow with increasing voltage, others like MoS/WTe and MoTe/WS hetero bilayers show promise due to their ability to prevent voltage drop. The presented innovative concept of utilizing compressive strain of TMD bilayers to generate a tribo-piezoelectric effect for nanogenerators has a potential to contribute to the development of efficient and sustainable energy harvesting devices.",

These findings demonstrate the capability of Brillouin microscopy to probe the mechanical properties of cancer cells at the subcellular level. This technique holds significant potential for advancing cancer research by providing insights into the mechanical behavior of melanoma cells, which could inform the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies based on cellular biomechanics.",

Compared to conventional elastomeric adhesives, SMP adhesives are distinguished by the so-called rubber-to-glass (R2G) adhesion, which involves contact in the rubbery state followed by detachment in the glassy state. This process, through a shape-locking effect, enhances adhesion strength by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional adhesive contact. Here, we investigate the fundamental problem of a rigid sphere undergoing R2G adhesion with an SMP substrate of finite thickness through experiments, finite element (FE) simulations, and theoretical modeling. It is demonstrated that during press-in, the contact problem can be modeled as a rigid oblate spheroid contacting an infinite substrate, while the pull-off process can be described by a modified ball-and-socket model. These equivalent models yield practically useful analytical solutions for the contact radius during press-in and the R2G adhesion force during pull-off. A critical thickness-to-contact-radius ratio of around 5 is identified, below which the thickness effect becomes significant. These insights provide valuable guidance for the design and application of SMP-based smart adhesives.",

This functional aspect makes MSM Heuslers promising for integration into smart micro/nanodevices, including sensors, energy harvesters, and actuators. Controlling the martensitic microstructure, which determines the magnetic characteristics, is among the key points for optimization of the magnetic functional properties of these materials at different length scales. Here, we report a strategy for manipulating the magnetic properties of spatially confined epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films grown on Cr(001)//MgO(001) by twinning configuration engineering in the low-temperature ferromagnetic (martensitic) phase. We show how the twinning configurations in the continuous films and the micropatterned structures can be switched from Y-type (showing negligible magnetic stray field) into X-type (presenting significant magnetic stray field) by a post-annealing process. Advanced characterization techniques enable us to analyze the atomic structure and the surface quality of the annealed samples and to disentangle the twin-switching phenomenon. The martensitic microstructure engineering reported in this study introduces a simple method for promoting the magnetic stray-field contribution at the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial thin films and micropatterns initially showing a negligible magnetic stray field.",

However, almost all existing directional emitters are assemblies of passive optical antennae and external light sources, which are usually bulky, fragile, and with unendurable loss of light power. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a new conceptual design of directional emitter, by using a single surface-emitting laser source itself to achieve dynamically controlled beam steering. The laser is built on photonic crystals that operates near the band edges in the continuum. By shrinking laser sizes into tens-of-wavelength, the optical modes quantize in three-dimensional momentum space, and each of them directionally radiates towards the far-field. Further utilizing the luminescence spectrum shifting effect under current injection, we consecutively select a sequence of modes into lasing action and show the laser maintaining in single mode operation with linewidths at a minimum of $1.8$ MHz and emitting power of $\\sim$ ten milliwatts, and we demonstrate fast beam steering across a range of $3.2^\\circ \\times 4^\\circ$ in a time scale of $500$ nanoseconds.

Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.",

      "abstract": "In many biological materials such as nacre and bone, the material structure consists of hard grains and soft interfaces, with the interfaces playing a significant role in the material's mechanical behavior. This type of structures has been utilized in the design of various bio-inspired composite materials. Such applications often require the materials to exhibit a specified nonlinear stress-strain relationship. A key challenge lies in identifying appropriate interface properties from an infinite search space to achieve a given target stress-strain curve. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework specifically tailored for the inverse design of interfaces in bio-inspired composites. As a notable advantage, this method is capable of expanding the design space, allowing the discovery of optimal solutions even when the target curve deviates significantly from the initial dataset. Furthermore, our results show that BO can identify distinct interface designs that produce similar target stress-strain responses, yet differ in their deformation and failure mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed BO framework to address a wide range of inverse design challenges in nonlinear mechanics problems.",

      "abstract": "In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.",

      "abstract": "Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface phonon arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.",

However, electroadhesive clutches in the literature engage to and release from substrates several orders of magnitude slower than a traditional electrostatic model would predict, limiting their usefulness in high-bandwidth applications. We develop a novel electromechanical model for electroadhesion, factoring in polarization dynamics and contact mechanics between the dielectric and substrate. We show in simulation and experimentally how different design parameters affect the engagement and release times of electroadhesive clutches to metallic substrates. In particular, we find that higher drive frequencies and narrower substrate aspect ratios enable significantly faster dynamics. We demonstrate designs with engagement times under 15 us and release times as low as 875 us, which are 10x and 17.1x faster, respectively, than the best times found in prior literature.",

This response is highly sensitive to the electronic band structure, which can be engineered with remarkable precision in moir\\'e superlattices formed from atomically thin quantum materials. Moir\\'e superlattices host complex Fermi surface reconstructions near van Hove singularities (vHSs) in the electronic density of states. However, the role of these reconstructions in shaping NLER remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically explore NLER in moir\\'e superlattices of twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) by tuning the Fermi level across multiple moir\\'e bands on both sides of the charge neutrality point. We observe sharp variations and sign reversals in the NLER appearing via extrinsic pathways near mid-band vHSs. The second-order conductivity close to the vHSs demonstrates a much higher value than previous reports of extrinsic NLER in any other material. Our results demonstrate that NLER can serve as a sensitive probe of Fermi surface reconstructions and establish tDBLG as a versatile and highly efficient platform for generating and controlling the nonlinear electrical response.",

The resulting elastic free energy functional of the deflection field is shown to be equivalent to a minimal density functional of phase-field crystal theory plus a Gaussian curvature-related term. The proposed elastic model constructs a phase diagram based on free energy minimization, quantitatively agreeing with the buckling transitions observed in former experiments. The emerging hexagonal buckling system is shown to be equivalent to a two-dimensional crystal with proper scalings. We further conducted simulations of repeated buckling under cyclic stress to demonstrate a dynamically modulated structural adhesive, which resembles the physical process of repeated crystallization and melting near a critical temperature.",

      "abstract": "Thermal management is ubiquitous in the modern world and indispensable for a sustainable future. Radiative heat management provides unique advantages because the heat transfer can be controlled by the surface. However, different surface emissivities require different tuning strategies. Here, we demonstrate a triple-mode mid-infrared modulator that can switch between passive heating and cooling suitable for all types of object surface emissivities. The device is composed of a surface-textured infrared-semi-transparent elastomer coated with a metallic back reflector, which is biaxially strained to sequentially achieve three fundamental modes: emission, reflection, and transmission. By analyzing and optimizing the coupling between optical and mechanical properties, we achieve a performance of emittance contrast = 0.58, transmittance contrast = 0.49, and reflectance contrast = 0.39. The device can provide a new design paradigm of radiation heat regulation to develop the next generation wearable devices, robotics, and camouflage technology.",

      "abstract": "Most polymers are long-lasting and produced from monomers derived from fossil fuel sources. Bio-based and/or biodegradable plastics have been proposed as a sustainable alternative. Amongst those available, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) shows great potential across a large variety of applications but is currently limited to packaging, cosmetics and tissue engineering due to its relatively poor physical properties. An expansion of its uses can be accomplished by developing nanocomposites where PHAs are used as the polymer matrix. Herein, a PHA biopolyester was melt blended with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) or with a 1:1 hybrid mixture of GNPs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The resulting nanocomposites exhibited enhanced thermal stability while their Young's modulus roughly doubled compared to pure PHA. The hybrid nanocomposites percolated electrically at lower nanofiller loadings compared to the GNP-PHA system. The electrical conductivity at 15 wt.% loading was ~ 6 times higher than the GNP-based sample. As a result, the electromagnetic interference shielding performance of the hybrid material was around 50% better than the pure GNPs nanocomposites, exhibiting shielding effectiveness above 20 dB, which is the threshold for common commercial applications. The thermal conductivity increased significantly for both types of bio-nanocomposites and reached values around 5 W K-1 m-1 with the hybrid-based material displaying the best performance. Considering the solvent-free and industrially compatible production method, the proposed multifunctional materials are promising to expand the range of application of PHAs and increase the environmental sustainability of the plastic and plastic electronics industry.",

Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.",

      "abstract": "Recently, radical progress in machine learning (ML) has revolutionized computational materials science, enabling unprecedentedly rapid materials discovery and property prediction, but the quantum many-body problem -- which is the key to understanding excited-state properties, ranging from transport to optics -- remains challenging due to the complexity of the nonlocal and energy-dependent interactions. Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.",

PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.   The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.   The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.",

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the introduction of a waist joint improves climbing performance, particularly enhancing tracking ability on narrow walls.",

By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder.

      "abstract": "Non-Euclidean surfaces are ubiquitous in numerous engineering fields, such as automotive, aerospace, and biomedical engineering domains. Morphing origami has numerous potential engineering applications, including soft robots, mechanical metamaterials, antennas, aerospace structures, and biomedical devices, owing to its intrinsic morphing features from two-dimensional (2D) planes to three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. However, the current one-dimensional (1D) hinge deformation-driven transformation of foldable origami with rigid or slightly deformable panels cannot achieve a 3D complex and large curvilinear morphing. Moreover, most active origami structures use thin hinges with soft materials on their creases, thus resulting in a lower load capability. This study proposes a novel origami morphing method that demonstrates large free-form surface morphing, e.g., Euclidean to non-Euclidean surface morphing with shape-locking. We embedded tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels during the extrusion-based 3D printing of shape memory polymers. The extrusion-based 3D printing of isotropic shape memory polymers can produce tensorial anisotropic stress in origami panels during fabrication, which can realize large non-Euclidean surface morphing with multiple deformation modes. The connecting topology of the origami unit cells influences the global morphing behavior owing to the interaction of the deformation of adjacent panels. Non-Euclidean morphing integrated with four-dimensional (4D) printing can provide multimodal shape locking at material and structural levels. The non-Euclidean surface morphing caused by tensorial residual stress in the panel during 3D printing expands the design space of origami and kirigami structures.",

      "abstract": "Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.",

      "abstract": "Starch based scaffolds are considered as promising biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. In this study, a highly porous starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based nanocomposite scaffold with a gradient pore structure was made by incorporating different bio-additives, including citric acid, cellulose nanofibers, and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles. The scaffold was prepared by employing unidirectional and cryogenic freeze-casting and subsequently freeze-drying methods. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the cross-linking of starch and PVA molecules through multiple esterification phenomenon in presence of citric acid as a cross-linking agent. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations showed formation of aligned lamellar pores with a gradient pore width in the range of 80 to 292 um, which well meets the pore size requirement for bone regeneration, and also well dispersion of cellulose and HA nanofillers within the scaffold matrix. Based on the mechanical testing results, the cellulose-HA reinforced scaffold possesses sufficient compressive modulus and yield strength for non-load bearing applications in the dry state; and also it presents fast responsive shape recovery in the wet state. According to in-vitro assessments, apatite phase mineralization was extensively induced in the presence of HA nanoparticles as heterogeneous nucleating sites. Also, it was revealed that cellulose and HA nanofillers decelerate and accelerate the scaffold biodegradation rate, respectively. MTT assay proved good cytocompatibility of the nanocomposite scaffold with osteoblast cells. Finally, it was shown that the introduced scaffold provides a suitable platform for the cells adhesion.",

However, the behaviour of colloidal particles under the influence of alternating current (AC) electric fields remains a topic of ongoing investigation due to the complex effects of various control parameters. Here we examine the role of several factors including particle size, zeta potential, voltage and frequency of the applied field in the formation of different structural configurations ranging from crystals to glasses, and observe interesting and unexpected behaviours in the structure formation. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of structure formation; the nature of diffusion and active motion in these out-of-equilibrium systems, and show how that leads to the formation of close-packed or open structures. Lastly, we investigate the frequency-driven disorder-order-disorder phase transition in colloidal crystals, which is a starting point for building reconfigurable systems. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significant roles of various factors in electric field-induced assembly of colloidal particles, as well as pave the way for potential applications in micro-robotics and next-generation materials.",

However, full understanding and control has not been reached yet and the ideal material still needs to be found. Here we report ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia superlattices made out of zirconium-substituted hafnia (Hf$_{1-x}$Zr$_x$O$_2$) sublayers of varying stoichiometries alternating with pure ZrO$_2$ sublayers. It is observed that the ZrO$_2$ layers in these superlattices act as a booster for the total remnant polarization (P$_r$). By combining the benefits of the ZrO$_2$ layers and the added interfaces, which help prevent breakdown, we fabricate superlattices with a total 87.5% ZrO$_2$ content, exhibiting record polarizations with a 2P$_r$ value of 84 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$ that can be cycled 10$^9$ times, while maintaining a 2P$_r$ > 20 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$. Next to these attractive properties, substitution of HfO$_2$ by the much more abundant ZrO$_2$ offers a significant step towards the sustainable application of these devices.",

      "abstract": "Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is a technique used to create oxide-ceramic coatings on lightweight metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, and titanium. PEO is known for producing coatings with high corrosion resistance and strong adhesion to the substrate. The process involves generating short-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric breakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single microdischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where the active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1 mm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode material, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is composed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide (0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights into the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the induced gas bubble formation. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to estimate surface and electron temperatures by fitting Bremsstrahlung and Planck's law to the continuum spectrum of the microdischarges. To evaluate the impact of the microdischarges on coating morphology, the resulting oxide layers on the metal tips are analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The study demonstrates that microdischarge behaviour is significantly influenced by the substrate material, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration, all of which impact the coating morphology. Under the conditions studied in this work, aluminium exhibits longer microdischarge and bubble lifetimes, with fewer cracks on the top layer of the coating, whereas titanium showed faster, shorter-lived bubbles due to more rapid microdischarge events.",

      "abstract": "Nonlinear transport enabled by symmetry breaking in quantum materials has aroused considerable interest in condensed matter physics and interdisciplinary electronics. However, the nonlinear optical response in centrosymmetric Dirac semimetals via the defect engineering has remained highly challenging. Here, we observe the helicity-dependent terahertz (THz) emission in Dirac semimetal PtTe2 thin films via circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) under normal incidence. This is activated by artificially controllable out-of-plane Te-vacancy defect gradient, which is unambiguously evidenced by the electron ptychography. The defect gradient lowers the symmetry, which not only induces the band spin splitting, but also generates the giant Berry curvature dipole (BCD) responsible for the CPGE. Such BCD-induced helicity-dependent THz emission can be manipulated by the Te-vacancy defect concentration. Furthermore, temperature evolution of the THz emission features the minimum of the THz amplitude due to the carrier compensation. Our work provides a universal strategy for symmetry breaking in centrosymmetric Dirac materials for efficient nonlinear transport and facilitates the promising device applications in integrated optoelectronics and spintronics.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety. The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation. The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety during the construction process.",

      "abstract": "Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\\Phi$ with period $\\Phi_{0}^s=\\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\\frac{1}{2})\\Phi_{0}^s < \\Phi < (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.",

      "abstract": "Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.",

      "abstract": "Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity, accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date, including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded, highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling, providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.",

      "abstract": "Efficient signal representation is essential for the functioning of living and artificial systems operating under resource constraints. A widely recognized framework for deriving such representations is the information bottleneck method, which yields the optimal strategy for encoding a random variable, such as the signal, in a way that preserves maximal information about a functionally relevant variable, subject to an explicit constraint on the amount of information encoded. While in its general formulation the method is numerical, it admits an analytical solution in an important special case where the variables involved are jointly Gaussian. In this setting, the solution predicts discrete transitions in the dimensionality of the optimal representation as the encoding capacity is increased. Although these signature transitions, along with other features of the optimal strategy, can be derived from a constrained optimization problem, a clear and intuitive understanding of their emergence is still lacking. In our work, we advance our understanding of the Gaussian information bottleneck method through multiple mutually enriching perspectives, including geometric and information-theoretic ones. These perspectives offer novel intuition about the set of optimal encoding directions, the nature of the critical points where the optimal number of encoding components changes, and about the way the optimal strategy navigates between these critical points. We then apply our treatment of the method to a previously studied signal prediction problem, obtaining new insights on how different features of the signal are encoded across multiple components to enable optimal prediction of future signals. Altogether, our work deepens the foundational understanding of the information bottleneck method in the Gaussian setting, motivating the exploration of analogous perspectives in broader, non-Gaussian contexts.",

Intercalation into free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) has received special attention, as graphene is stable, chemically inert and enables one to study the atomic structure of the intercalated 2DM using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was also discovered that the protecting action of graphene sheets makes it possible to not only stabilize the encapsulated single sheets of marginally stable layered materials, but also synthesize completely new 2D systems inside BLG, which in comparison to the bulk graphite allows for easier intercalation and much larger increase in the inter-layer separation of the sheets. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in this area, with a special focus on new materials created inside BLG. We compare the experimental findings to the theoretical predictions, pay special attention to the discrepancies and outline the challenges in the field. Finally, we discuss unique opportunities offered by the intercalation into 2DMs beyond graphene and their heterostructures.",

      "abstract": "To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in wetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to the sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is imperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound understanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of surfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The influence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of volatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and copper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is created by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser processing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D). Our results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper surfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and is dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate (Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by tailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of primary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle, wetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the pattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors air-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing the aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite increased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were observed.",

      "abstract": "Recent experiments by S. Krishnia et al., Nano Lett. 23, 6785 (2023) reported an unprecedentedly large enhancement of torques upon inserting thin Al layer in Co/Pt heterostructure that suggested the presence of a Rashba-like interaction at the metallic Co/Al interface. Based on first-principles calculations, we reveal the emergence of a large helical orbital texture in reciprocal space at the interfacial Co layer, whose origin is attributed to the orbital Rashba effect due to the formation of the surface states at the Co/Al interface and where spin-orbit coupling is found to produce smaller contributions with a higher-order winding of the orbital momentum. Our results unveil that the orbital texture gives rise to a non-equilibrium orbital accumulation producing large current-induced torques, thus providing an essential theoretical background for the experimental data and advancing the use of orbital transport phenomena in all-metallic magnetic systems with light elements.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.",

By carefully adjusting these parameters, we are able to drive SmN from an insulating ferromagnetic state to a ferromagnetic metallic state. However, no signatures of previously reported superconductivity were observed down to 0.35 K, even in the most conductive samples. We discuss possible scenarios for the absence of superconductivity in these films and examine implications for the underlying pairing mechanism in this material. These findings open a new pathway for the epitaxial engineering of multifunctional materials, enabling the monolithic integration of diverse electronic phases, such as ferromagnetism and metallicity, without the lattice mismatch and strain typically associated with heteroepitaxial growth of dissimilar materials.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating back support exoskeletons (BSEs) in workplace settings addressing the limitations of traditional methods like electromyography (EMG), which are impractical due to their sensitivity to external disturbances and user sweat. Variability in BSE performance among users, often due to joint misalignment and anthropomorphic differences, can lead to discomfort and reduced effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating a compact load cell into the exoskeleton's thigh cuff. This small load cell provides precise force measurements without significantly altering the exoskeleton's kinematics or inertia, enabling real-time assessment of exoskeleton assistance in both laboratory and workplace environments, Experimental validation during load-lifting tasks demonstrated that the load cell effectively captures interface forces between the BSE and human subjects, showing stronger correlations with the user's muscle activity when the BSE provides effective assistance. This innovative sensing interface offers a stable, practical alternative to EMG and respiratory gas measurements, facilitating more accurate and convenient evaluation of BSE performance in real-world industrial and laboratory settings. The proposed method holds promise for enhancing the adoption and effectiveness of BSEs by providing reliable, real-time feedback on their assistance capabilities.",

I-V and C-V characteristics from the TCAD models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements in the forward bias region. Discrepancies in the negative bias region are expected due to the ideality of the Schottky junctions considered in this study.

Since then, intelligent life has become the dominant direction of social development. Humidity sensors, as humidity detection tools, not only convey the comfort of human living environment, but also display great significance in the fields of meteorology, medicine, agriculture and industry. Graphene-based materials exhibit tremendous potential in humidity sensing owing to their ultra-high specific surface area and excellent electron mobility under room temperature for application in humidity sensing. This review begins with the introduction of examples of various synthesis strategies of graphene, followed by the device structure and working mechanism of graphene-based humidity sensor. In addition, several different structural design methods of graphene are summarized, demonstrating the structural design of graphene can not only optimize the performance of graphene, but also bring significant advantages in humidity sensing. Finally, key challenges hindering the further development and practical application of high-performance graphene-based humidity sensors are discussed, followed by presenting the future perspectives.",

      "abstract": "This study systematically investigates the dynamics of the bacterial transition from free-swimming to surface adhesion, a process characterized by both height $h$ and inclination angle $\\Psi$. The surface entrapment process is divided into three main stages. Initially, bacteria swim towards the surface at an approach velocity proportional to the motor rotation frequency. Subsequently, during the reorientation stage, the cotangent of the inclination angle decays exponentially with the product of the motor rotation frequency and time. Finally, the combined effect of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces drives the bacteria to a stable fixed point $(h^{*},\\Psi^{*})$ near the surface. Bacteria with left-handed chiral flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. The stable height, inclination angle, and radius of curvature of these circular trajectories are collectively determined by the flagellar morphology and ionic strength of the electrolyte solution. More precisely, increasing the contour length of the flagellum decreases the stable inclination angle and increases the radius of curvature. In contrast, decreasing the ionic strength increases the stable height and radius of curvature, while also decreasing the stable inclination angle. Typically, the stable inclination angle falls within $(\\pi/2,\\pi)$, the stable height ranges from a few nanometers to approximately one hundred nanometers, and the radius of curvature of the circular motion spans several to tens of micrometers.",

      "abstract": "In systems control, the dynamics of a system are governed by modulating its inputs to achieve a desired outcome. For example, to control the thrust of a quad-copter propeller the controller modulates its rotation rate, relying on a straightforward mapping between the input rotation rate and the resulting thrust. This mapping can be inverted to determine the rotation rate needed to generate a desired thrust. However, in complex systems, such as flapping-wing robots where intricate fluid motions are involved, mapping inputs (wing kinematics) to outcomes (aerodynamic forces) is nontrivial and inverting this mapping for real-time control is computationally impractical. Here, we report a machine-learning solution for the inverse mapping of a flapping-wing system based on data from an experimental system we have developed. Our model learns the input wing motion required to generate a desired aerodynamic force outcome. We used a sequence-to-sequence model tailored for time-series data and augmented it with a novel adaptive-spectrum layer that implements representation learning in the frequency domain. To train our model, we developed a flapping wing system that simultaneously measures the wing's aerodynamic force and its 3D motion using high-speed cameras. We demonstrate the performance of our system on an additional open-source dataset of a flapping wing in a different flow regime. Results show superior performance compared with more complex state-of-the-art transformer-based models, with 11% improvement on the test datasets median loss. Moreover, our model shows superior inference time, making it practical for onboard robotic control. Our open-source data and framework may improve modeling and real-time control of systems governed by complex dynamics, from biomimetic robots to biomedical devices.",

The dynamic formation of the connections is reminiscent of a biological learning mechanism known as synaptogenesis, and it is carried out by an electrochemical reaction that we name field-directed polymerization. We employ it to dendritic connections and, by modulating the growth parameters, control material properties such as the resistance and the time constants relevant for plasticity. We believe these results will inspire further research towards the complex integration of polymerized synapses for brain-inspired computing.",

      "abstract": "Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.",

Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization, projection micro stereolithography, and volumetric printing, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution and/or potential applications for biofabrication. In this study, we introduce dynamic interface printing (DIP), a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air-liquid boundary to rapidly generate cm-scale three-dimensional structures within tens of seconds. Distinct from volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry, or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print via conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in-situ, overprinting, structural parallelisation, and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we showcase that the formation of surface waves at this boundary enables enhanced mass transport, material flexibility, and permits three-dimensional particle patterning. We therefore anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high resolution, scalable throughput, and biocompatible printing is required.",

Adding a post-processing annealing step after C60 evaporation, further improves the fill factor (FF) by 20% from the control to the DAP + post-annealing devices. Using hyperspectral photoluminescence microscopy, we demonstrate that annealing helps improve compositional homogeneity at the top and bottom interfaces of the solar cell, which prevents detrimental bandgap pinning in the devices and improves C60 adhesion. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we show that DAP reacts with formamidinium present near the surface of the perovskite lattice to form a larger molecular cation, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidinium (THP) that remains at the interface. Combining the use of DAP and the annealing of C60 interface, we fabricate Si-perovskite tandems with PCE of 25.29%, compared to 23.26% for control devices. Our study underscores the critical role of chemical reactivity and thermal post-processing of the C60/Lewis-base passivator interface in minimizing device losses and advancing solar-cell performance of wide-bandgap mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite for tandem application.",

At the same time, the intercalation can result in the formation of structural defects, or defects can appear under external stimuli, which can affect materials performance. These aspects have received so far little attention in the dedicated experiments. In this study, we investigate the behavior of atomic-scale defects in iron chlorides intercalated into bilayer graphene (BLG) by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations. We observe transformations between the FeCl2 and FeCl3 phases and elucidate the role of defects in the transformations. Specifically, three types of defects are identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl2 domains, Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl3 domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. We also observed a crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe5Cl18 which has not been reported before. Our findings not only advance the understanding of intercalation mechanism of 2D materials but also highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.",

      "abstract": "Robot hands that imitate the shape of the human body have been actively studied, and various materials and mechanisms have been proposed to imitate the human body. Although the use of soft materials is advantageous in that it can imitate the characteristics of the human body's epidermis, it increases the number of parts and makes assembly difficult in order to perform complex movements. In this study, we propose a skin-skeleton integrated robot hand that has 15 degrees of freedom and consists of four parts. The developed robotic hand is mostly composed of a single flexible part produced by a 3D printer, and while it can be easily assembled, it can perform adduction, flexion, and opposition of the thumb, as well as flexion of four fingers.",

      "abstract": "The expression of chirality in adsorption phenomena constitutes an important topic, not only relevant to asymmetric transformations involving solid surfaces, but also to the emergence of homochirality in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial scenarios. Methanol (MeOH) aggregation on graphite/graphene, one of the most idealized adsorbate-adsorbent systems, lead to islands of cyclic clusters of different sizes (Nano. Lett., 2016, 16, 3142-3147). Here, we show that this aggregation occurs enantioselectively affording 2D conglomerates depending on the size of clusters, in close analogy to a Pasteurian racemate. Homochiral sequences are held together by hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions, whose absolute configurations can be appropriately specified. A discussion involving the dichotomy between 2D racemates and conglomerates, is offered as well. In addition, the present simulations showcase a broad range of acyclic and cyclic structures, even if some discrete rings are the dominant species, in agreement with previous experimental data and theoretical modeling. Our results indicate that MeOH clusters show binding energies close to the experimental values, remaining intact at temperatures as high as 120 K and up to 150 K.",

In this work, we employ first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study its many-electron interactions and excited-state properties. We find enhanced many-electron interactions that dominate quasiparticle energies and optical responses in {\\alpha}-RuCl3. Our calculated quasiparticle band gap of bulk structure is about 1.75 eV that agrees well with recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, our calculated first and second primary bright excitons are located at 1.23 eV and 1.98 eV, respectively. These excitons show good consistency with the main features observed in the optical absorption spectrum. We extend our investigation to monolayer {\\alpha}-RuCl3, examining the zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases. In addition to significant excitonic effects, the optical spectrum of the zigzag AFM phase exhibits anisotropic behavior, while the FM phase demonstrates isotropic characteristics. The different optical response behaviors provide an efficient approach to identify the energy nearly degenerate magnetic states, which can both potentially exist in fabricated samples.",

      "abstract": "Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.",

Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg, the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding their role beyond locomotion.",

      "abstract": "Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a thermochromic material that undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconducting state to a rutile metallic state at 68 degrees C, a temperature close to room temperature. This property makes VO2 particularly valuable in applications such as optical and electrical switches, data storage, neuromorphic computing, and remarkably dynamic smart windows for solar radiation control. VO2 typically needs to be synthesized for these applications as nanostructured thin films. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to control the thermochromic properties of VO2 through crystal structure tuning, doping, and the development of VO2 nanocomposites. Additionally, introducing nano- and mesoporosity has been shown to enhance the optical properties of thermochromic VO2 films. This study presents a methodology for producing highly porous, aerogel-like V2O5 films, which can be thermally processed to form aerogel-like VO2 films. This process is based on sequential plasma polymerization and plasma etching to produce aerogel-like V2O5 films that are annealed to yield ultraporous nanocrystalline VO2 films. The sacrificial vanadium-containing plasma polymers are obtained by remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) using vanadyl porphyrin as a precursor and Ar as plasma gas. The aerogel-like VO2 films show exceptional thermochromic performance with luminous transmittances higher than 54%, solar modulation up to 18.8%, and IR modulation up to 35.5%. The presented plasma methodology is versatile, allowing both the synthesis of VO2 plasmonic structures to enhance the thermochromic response and the encapsulation of films to improve their stability in air dramatically. Additionally, this solvent-free synthetic method is fully compatible with doping procedures, scalable, and holds great potential for designing and optimizing smart window coatings.",

However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel \"ice-assisted transfer\" technique that combines rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two applications: (1) antireflective \"moth-eye\" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring scalable nanostructuring.

      "abstract": "Humans excel in navigating diverse, complex environments with agile motor skills, exemplified by parkour practitioners performing dynamic maneuvers, such as climbing up walls and jumping across gaps. Reproducing these agile movements with simulated characters remains challenging, in part due to the scarcity of motion capture data for agile terrain traversal behaviors and the high cost of acquiring such data. In this work, we introduce PARC (Physics-based Augmentation with Reinforcement Learning for Character Controllers), a framework that leverages machine learning and physics-based simulation to iteratively augment motion datasets and expand the capabilities of terrain traversal controllers. PARC begins by training a motion generator on a small dataset consisting of core terrain traversal skills. The motion generator is then used to produce synthetic data for traversing new terrains. However, these generated motions often exhibit artifacts, such as incorrect contacts or discontinuities. To correct these artifacts, we train a physics-based tracking controller to imitate the motions in simulation. The corrected motions are then added to the dataset, which is used to continue training the motion generator in the next iteration. PARC's iterative process jointly expands the capabilities of the motion generator and tracker, creating agile and versatile models for interacting with complex environments. PARC provides an effective approach to develop controllers for agile terrain traversal, which bridges the gap between the scarcity of motion data and the need for versatile character controllers.",

      "abstract": "Contacts between particles in dense, sheared suspensions are believed to underpin much of their rheology. Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up new ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.",

      "abstract": "The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.   In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.",

      "abstract": "Models of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model for the air puff test were analysed. Using Abaqus, the air puff test is applied to eyes with varying biomechanical parameters, such as material properties, corneal thickness, and radius. A reduced order model of the air puff (a turbulent impinging jet) has been acquired to decrease simulation time from 48 hours for the FSI model to approximately 12 minutes for the finite element analysis (FEA) model alone. To further accelerate simulations and improve model accuracy, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) will be integrated with the reduced-order model. This hybrid approach will help expand the model to a larger dataset, enhancing intraocular pressure (IOP) estimation accuracy and the corneal material properties algorithm through inverse FEA. Additionally, a neural network (NN) framework with embedded Gaussian-modulated waveforms is proposed to model the pressure and deformation distributions on the corneal surface as functions of spatial and temporal parameters. By learning the relationship between corneal biomechanical inputs such as Corneal Central Thickness (CCT), Intraocular Pressure (IOP), and baseline properties (Mu), and the governing coefficients of pressure and deformation, the network accurately reconstructs the result that matches well with the high-fidelity CFD data. This approach can quickly capture the distribution of pressure and deformation. It can also provide insights into the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of pressure and deformation, giving a more comprehensive understanding of fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the air puff test.",

      "abstract": "Thermal comfort of textiles plays an indispensable role in the process of human civilization. Advanced textile for personal thermal management shapes body microclimates by merely regulating heat transfer between the skin and local ambient without wasting excess energy. Therefore, numerous efforts have recently been devoted to the development of advanced thermoregulatory textiles. In this review, we provide a unified perspective on those state-of-the-art efforts by emphasizing the design of diverse heat transfer pathways. We focus on engineering certain physical quantities to tailor the heat transfer pathways, such as thermal emittance/absorptance, reflectance and transmittance in near-infrared and mid-infrared radiation, as well as thermal conductance in conduction. Tuning those heat transfer pathways can achieve different functionalities for personal thermal management, such as passive cooling, warming, or even dual-mode (cooling-warming), either static switching or dynamic adapting. Finally, we point out the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field, including but not limited to the impact of evaporation and convection with missing blocks of heat pathways, the bio-inspired and artificial-intelligence-guided design of advanced functional textiles.",

      "abstract": "Shape transformation is crucial for the survival, adaptation, predation, defense, and reproduction of organisms in complex environments. It also serves as a key mechanism for the development of various applications, including soft robotics, biomedical systems, and flexible electronic devices. However, among the various deformation actuation modes, the design of deformable structures, the material response characteristics, and the miniaturization of devices remain challenges. As materials and structures are scaled down to the microscale, their performance becomes strongly correlated with size, leading to significant changes in, or even the failure of, many physical mechanisms that are effective at the macroscale. Additionally, electrostatic forces, surface tension, and viscous forces dominate at the microscale, making it difficult for structures to deform or causing them to fracture easily during deformation. Moreover, despite the prominence of acoustic actuation among various deformation drive modes, it has received limited attention. Here, we introduce an acoustical shape-morphing micromachine (ASM) that provides shape variability through a pair of microbubbles and the micro-hinges connecting them. When excited by external acoustic field, interaction forces are generated between these microbubbles, providing the necessary force and torque for the deformation of the entire micromachine within milliseconds. We established programmable design principles for ASM, enabling the forward and inverse design of acoustic deformation, precise programming, and information storage. Furthermore, we adjusted the amplitude of acoustic excitation to demonstrate the controllable switching of the micromachine among various modes. By showcasing the micro bird, we illustrated the editing of multiple modes, achieving a high degree of controllability, stability, and multifunctionality.",

      "title": "Role of Wettability, Adhesion, and Instabilities in Transitions During   Lubricated Sliding Friction",
      "abstract": "Lubricated contacts in soft materials are important in various engineering systems and natural settings. Three major lubrication regimes are boundary (BL), mixed (ML), and elasto-hydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication, where the contact region is dry, partially wetted, or fully wetted, respectively. The transition between these regimes is insufficiently understood, especially for soft contacts, which impedes desired control of lubricated sliding friction. Here, we report on the role of solid wettability and adhesion on these transitions. Wettability of glycerol on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and adhesion between a glass indenter and PDMS, were varied by exposure of the PDMS to an ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-Ozone) cleaner. By combining friction tests and visualization, we demonstrate that the transition from ML to BL regime is dominated by the wettability of the lubricant; increasing wettability of glycerol makes removal of liquid from the contact region more difficult. Transition from EHL to ML is related to a series of events with increasing normal load, which are thinning of the lubricant layer, sudden jump to contact between the glass indenter and solid substrate across a gap of tens to a few hundreds of nanometers, and attendant elastic instabilities such as wrinkling and stick-slip. These results provide a deeper understanding of transitions in lubricated frictional behavior of soft materials which govern the maximum and minimum friction achievable.",

While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.",

      "abstract": "Migrating active deicing capabilities to transparent materials with low thermal conductivity has a high potential to improve the operations of several seminal industries in the automotive, robotic, energy, and aerospace sectors. However, the development of efficient and environmentally friendly deicing methods is yet in its infancy regarding their compatibility with end-user surfaces at relevant scales and real-world operations. Herein, we approach deicing through nanoscale surface activation enabled by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), allowing efficient on-demand deicing of surface areas spanning several square centimeters covered with thick layers of glace ice. We contemplate SAW-based deicing from a twofold perspective: First, we demonstrate its functionality both with a bulk piezoelectric material (LiNbO3) and a piezo-electric film (ZnO), the latter proving its versatile applicability to a large variety of functional materials with practical importance; second, we gain fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for efficient deicing using SAWs. In particular, we show that SAW vibrational modes easily transport energy over greater distances outside the electrode areas and efficiently melt large ice aggregates covering the materials' surfaces. In addition, the essential physics of SAW-based deicing is inferred from a carefully designed experimental and numerical study. We support our findings by providing macroscopic camera snapshots captured in situ inside a climate chamber during deicing and highly resolved laser-doppler vibrometer scans of the undisturbed wavefields at room temperature. Great care was taken to deposit the interdigital transducers (IDTs) used for SAW excitation only on ice-free areas close to the chip edges, leaving most of the substrate used for deicing unaltered and, as a matter of fact, demonstrating transparent deicing solutions.",

      "abstract": "Flexible photovoltaics with a lightweight and adaptable nature that allows for deployment on curved surfaces and in building facades have always been a goal vigorously pursued by researchers in thin-film solar cell technology. The recent strides made in improving the sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency of kesterite Cu$_{2}$ZnSn(S, Se)$_{4}$ (CZTSSe) suggest it to be a perfect candidate. However, making use of rare Mo foil in CZTSSe solar cells causes severe problems in thermal expansion matching, uneven grain growth, and severe problems at the back contact of the devices. Herein, a strategy utilizing single-crystal graphene to modify the back interface of flexible CZTSSe solar cells is proposed. It will be shown that the insertion of graphene at the Mo foil/CZTSSe interface provides strong physical support for the subsequent deposition of the CZTSSe absorber layer, improving the adhesion between the absorber layer and the Mo foil substrate. Additionally, the graphene passivates the rough sites on the surface of the Mo foil, enhancing the chemical homogeneity of the substrate, and resulting in a more crystalline and homogeneous CZTSSe absorber layer on the Mo foil substrate. The detrimental reaction between Mo and CZTSSe has also been eliminated. Through an analysis of the electrical properties, it is found that the introduction of graphene at the back interface promotes the formation of a quasi-ohmic contact at the back contact, decreasing the back contact barrier of the solar cell, and leading to efficient collection of charges at the back interface. This investigation demonstrates that solution-based CZTSSe photovoltaic devices could form the basis of cheap and flexible solar cells.",

Here we provide an introduction to optimal control aimed at physicists working with soft and active matter. We describe two main categories of control, feedforward control and feedback control, and their corresponding optimal control methods. We emphasize their parallels to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and provide a worked example problem. Finally, we review recent studies of control in soft, active, and related systems.

A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the parameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics simulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode representing the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged properties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent atoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results reveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but improves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO suppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e., dislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary movements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives. Theoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield strength and predict the critical grain size. Additionally, the contributions of different plastic mechanisms to the overall stress response are separately quantified. These findings provide new insights into the design and performance optimization of RHEAs through nanostructural engineering.",

We suggest that the transferred triboelectric charge is dictated by half of the difference between thermoelectrically induced surface charges. Moreover, we quantitatively discuss electrostatic adhesion and static discharge between the transferred charges, which we may experience every day, including the role of surface charge inhomogeneity.

However, existing designs based on phase-change materials, nanostructures, or interfacial engineering suffer from limited rectification performance, configurational inflexibility, and poor scalability. Here, we present a thermomechanical metamaterial-based thermal diode that combines temperature-responsive actuation with structural bistability to achieve high-efficiency, nonreciprocal thermal transport. The device integrates shape memory alloy (SMA) springs with pre-buckled copper strips that undergo snap-through transitions in response to thermal gradients. This reconfiguration enables contact-based conduction in the forward mode and suppresses reverse heat flow via radiative isolation. We develop a coupled analytical model combining Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and a thermal resistance network, and validate the system through finite element (FE) simulations and experiments. The device achieves a thermal rectification ratio exceeding 900, with robust cycling stability and structural integrity. A modular stacking strategy further enhances scalability without compromising performance. This work establishes a new design framework for high-performance, passive thermal rectifiers that bridge mechanical metamaterials and advanced thermal engineering.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the electronic transitions and the Urbach tail band in three samples of the magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The PDF and CDF functions were derived from the absorption data of these substances in the UV-visible-NIR region of light spectrum. For the BiFeO$_3$-based materials, charge transfer (p-d and/or p-p) transitions in the energy range of 2.5 eV to 5.5 eV were identified through PDF and CDF analysis. Furthermore, spin-orbit and electron-lattice interactions along with a low-symmetry crystal field cause two doubly degenerate d-d transitions of Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the FeO$_6$ octahedra of the BiFeO$_3$ samples to occur between 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV. Additionally, the BiFeO3-based materials exhibited strong direct and weak indirect transitions near the band edge, which point to a complex band structure of BiFeO$_3$. Finally, the energy of the defect-induced Urbach tail band was directly calculated by examining the CDF function of the materials, yielding estimated values of approximately 0.40 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.33 eV for the bulk, nanostructured, and film BiFeO$_3$ samples, respectively.",

Instead, such systems are dominated by complex heterogeneous architectures and macroscopic interactions, presenting a classical many-body problem with unique complexities that remain less systematically understood than their quantum counterparts. In this work, we develop an operator-based theoretical framework to characterize these systems, using composite dielectric behavior as a paradigmatic example. By integrating effective medium theory with electromagnetic simulation techniques, we construct an operator that rigorously expresses the effective permittivity tensor as an exact functional. Global and local structure-property relationships can be established by analyzing the operator's structure through symmetric singular value decomposition and block operator matrix analysis, respectively. This framework bridges the gap between microscopic physics and macroscopic material behavior, offering a powerful approach for understanding diverse material properties and guiding the rational design of novel functional composites.",

The increased penetration depth of MeV electrons allows for structure determination from samples significantly thicker than those typically applicable in electron diffraction.

      "abstract": "Active matter has played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of non-equilibrium systems, leading to a fundamental shift in the study of biophysical phenomena. The foundation of active matter research is built on assumptions regarding the symmetry of microscopic constituents. While these assumptions have been validated extensively, instances of mixed or joint symmetries are prevalent in biological systems. This review explores the coexistence of polar and nematic order in active matter, emphasizing the theoretical and experimental challenges associated with these systems. By integrating insights from recent studies, we highlight the importance of considering mixed symmetries to accurately describe biological processes. This exploration not only benefits the field of biology but could also open new horizons for non-equilibrium physics, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding complex behavior in active matter.",

      "abstract": "Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.",

      "abstract": "One of the most elusive goals in myographic prosthesis control is the ability to reliably decode continuous positions simultaneously across multiple degrees-of-freedom. Goal: To demonstrate dexterous, natural, biomimetic finger and wrist control of the highly advanced robotic Modular Prosthetic Limb. Methods: We combine sequential temporal regression models and reinforcement learning using myographic signals to predict continuous simultaneous predictions of 7 finger and wrist degrees-of-freedom for 9 non-amputee human subjects in a minimally-constrained freeform training process. Results: We demonstrate highly dexterous 7 DoF position-based regression for prosthesis control from EMG signals, with significantly lower error rates than traditional approaches (p < 0.001) and nearly zero prediction response time delay (p < 0.001). Their performance can be continuously improved at any time using our freeform reinforcement process. Significance: We have demonstrated the most dexterous, biomimetic, and natural prosthesis control performance ever obtained from the surface EMG signal. Our reinforcement approach allowed us to abandon standard training protocols and simply allow the subject to move in any desired way while our models adapt. Conclusions: This work redefines the state-of-the-art in myographic decoding in terms of the reliability, responsiveness, and movement complexity available from prosthesis control systems. The present-day emergence and convergence of advanced algorithmic methods, experiment protocols, dexterous robotic prostheses, and sensor modalities represents a unique opportunity to finally realize our ultimate goal of achieving fully restorative natural upper-limb function for amputees.",

Modeling the detachment-reattachment sequence, known as stick-slip, imposes several challenges in a continuum framework. Here we exploit customized reversible cohesive elements in a hybrid finite element model that can handle occurrence of snap-through instabilities. The simulations capture various peeling phenomena that emerge in experimental observations, where layers are pulled from a flat, rigid substrate in the direction parallel to the surface. For long layers, periodicity in reattachment is shown to develop and is linked to the concept of Schallamach waves. Further, the connection between surface properties and stick-slip behavior is investigated: we find that stick-slip is linked to the propensity of the interface to localize deformation and damage. Beyond elucidating the various peeling behaviors and the detachment modes, the computational framework developed here provides a straightforward approach for investigation of complex delamination processes, which can guide development of future applications across different scales and in various settings.",

It has been demonstrated that this model spontaneously leads to microphase separation, resulting in the formation of a network of loops with transcription units serving as anchors. Here, we demonstrate how to compute the topological weights of loop networks with an arbitrary 1D pattern of transcription units along the fibre (or `polydisperse' loop networks), finding an analogy with networks of electric resistors in parallel or in series. We also show how the BEST (de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte) theorem in combinatorics can be used to find the combinatorial multiplicity of any class of loop networks. Our results can be used to compute the structural diversity, or Shannon entropy, of loop networks: we show that this quantity depends on the 1D patterning of transcription units along the chain, possibly providing a pathway to control transcriptional noise in eukaryotic genes.",

Metasurfaces, a class of 2D artificial materials based on the electromagnetic design of nanophotonic resonators, enable strong electromagnetic field enhancement and optical absorption engineering for a wide range of semiconductor materials. However, the engineering of semiconductor substrates into metasurfaces for improving SERS activity remains underexplored. Here, we develop an improved SERS metasurface platform that leverages the combination of titanium oxide (TiO2) and the emerging physical concept of optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) to boost the Raman emission. Moreover, fine-tuning of BIC-assisted resonant absorption offers a pathway for maximizing the photoinduced charge transfer effect (PICT) in SERS. We achieve ultrahigh values of BIC-assisted electric field enhancement (|E/E0|^2 ~ 10^3), challenging the preconception of weak electromagnetic (EM) field enhancement on semiconductor SERS substrates. Our BIC-assisted TiO2 metasurface platform offers a new dimension in spectrally-tunable SERS with earth-abundant and bio-compatible semiconductor materials, beyond the traditional plasmonic ones.",

B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.",

The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.",

Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.",

      "abstract": "Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles, into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs), the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures, restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet) to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models, grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.",

This has motivated researchers to mimic the design principles in natural composites to create tough transparent materials. However, current bio-inspired materials lack fabrication scalability or offer poor optical transmission. Here, an efficient, scalable bulk process is developed for creating optically transparent tough composites, resulting in a nacreous glass composite material with a four-fold increase in fracture toughness and a three-fold increase in flexural strength compared to conventional structural glasses, and with a 73% of average optical transmittance. The composite consists of glass flakes and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) assembled utilizing a centrifuge-based fabrication method that aligns and compacts the flakes into layers. To optimize the transparency of the structure, the refractive indices of the PMMA and glass are matched. Based on the results, this nacreous glass composite is proposed as a potential alternative in diverse architectural, vehicular, and electronics applications.",

      "abstract": "Vision language models (VLMs) exhibit vast knowledge of the physical world, including intuition of physical and spatial properties, affordances, and motion. With fine-tuning, VLMs can also natively produce robot trajectories. We demonstrate that eliciting wrenches, not trajectories, allows VLMs to explicitly reason about forces and leads to zero-shot generalization in a series of manipulation tasks without pretraining. We achieve this by overlaying a consistent visual representation of relevant coordinate frames on robot-attached camera images to augment our query. First, we show how this addition enables a versatile motion control framework evaluated across four tasks (opening and closing a lid, pushing a cup or chair) spanning prismatic and rotational motion, an order of force and position magnitude, different camera perspectives, annotation schemes, and two robot platforms over 220 experiments, resulting in 51% success across the four tasks. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed framework enables VLMs to continually reason about interaction feedback to recover from task failure or incompletion, with and without human supervision. Finally, we observe that prompting schemes with visual annotation and embodied reasoning can bypass VLM safeguards. We characterize prompt component contribution to harmful behavior elicitation and discuss its implications for developing embodied reasoning.

      "abstract": "The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties associated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW materials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice modulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice strain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further explore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the electrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper insight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW transition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW) shifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the electrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition becomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity indicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under pressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the electrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing pressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi liquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi surface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa, marked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the existence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide valuable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the critical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic ground state.",

Conventionally, experiments of cell-cell collisions are conducted on two-dimensional flat substrates, where colliding cells repolarize and move away upon contact with one another in \"contact inhibition of locomotion\" (CIL). Inspired by recent experiments that show cells on suspended nanofibers have qualitatively different CIL behaviors than those on flat substrates, we develop a phase field model of cell motility and two-cell collisions in fiber geometries. Our model includes cell-cell and cell-fiber adhesion, and a simple positive feedback mechanism of cell polarity. We focus on cell collisions on two parallel fibers, finding that larger cell deformability (lower membrane tension), larger positive feedback of polarization, and larger fiber spacing promote more occurrences of cells walking past one another. We can capture this behavior using a simple linear stability analysis on the cell-cell interface upon collision.",

      "abstract": "In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.",

We studied the low-temperature quantum magneto-transport to investigate the impact of lateral confinement on the states of topological carriers. Calculations showed that for narrow SnTe channels, almost flat bands with small energy dispersion are formed, and in the case of the [11] direction, the dispersionless states are strongly localized at the mesa edges. The measurements indicated that a current path associated with trivial states inside the quantum well was considerably narrowed due to disorder, leading to a significant reduction in channel conductivity. Such a high-resistance cross-junction has been used for measurements of non-linear transport in non-local configurations. The dependence of the differential resistance $R_\\text{d}$ on the direct current $I_\\text{DC}$ flowing through a selected pair of contacts was studied. For temperatures $T<1$ K, first an increase and then a decrease followed by a minimum of $R_\\text{d}$ were observed. This is a characteristic $R_\\text{d}(I_\\text{DC})$ relationship that is often considered as the signature of the hydrodynamic flow of a fermionic liquid in narrow quantum channels, which in the case of SnTe can be formed by topological states located entirely at the inner edges of a planar cross-junction.",

      "abstract": "A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.",

      "abstract": "Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.",

      "abstract": "The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.",

      "abstract": "Exploration of novel resistive switching materials attracts attention to replace conventional Si-based transistors and to achieve neuromorphic computing that can surpass the limit of the current Von-Neumann computing for the time of Internet of Things (IoT). Materials priorly used to serve in batteries have demonstrated metal-insulator transitions upon an electrical biasing due to resulting compositional change. This property is desirable for future resistive switching devices. Amorphous lithium lanthanum titanate (a-LLTO) was originally developed as a solid-state electrolyte with relatively high lithium ionic conductivity and low electronic conductivity among oxide-type solid electrolytes. However, it has been suggested that electric conductivity of a-LLTO changes depending on oxygen content. In this work, the investigation of switching behavior of a-LLTO was conducted by employing a range of voltage sweep techniques, ultimately establishing a stable and optimal operating condition within the voltage window of -3.5 V to 3.5 V. This voltage range effectively balances the desirable trait of a substantial resistance change by three orders of magnitude with the imperative avoidance of LLTO decomposition. This switching behavior is also confirmed at nanodevice of Ni/LLTO/Ni through in-situ biasing inside focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). Experiment and computation with different LLTO composition shows that LLTO has two distinct conductivity states due to Ti reduction. The distribution of these two states is discussed using simplified binary model, implying the conductive filament growth during low resistance state. Consequently, our study deepens understanding of LLTO electronic properties and encourages the interdisciplinary application of battery materials for resistive switching devices.",

      "abstract": "Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile IL framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient IL and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance. https://marmotlab.github.io/APEX/",

Using the Photon Momentum Method to directly measure trapping forces, we show that swarming clusters generate persistent, dissipative flows indicative of non equilibrium stationary motility within confined solenoidal mesostructures. These flagellar rotational dynamics break detailed balance in mesoscopic force space and exceed the limits of passive friction, as evidenced by force velocity correlations and vortex like circulations. By coarse graining cluster trajectories into an active Brownian phase space, we quantify the work performed by bacterial swarms at cooperative coupling to thermal fluctuations, resulting in dissipative Ohmic like currents overcoming conservative trapping. Our findings establish a generalizable approach to quantify collective motility and energetic dissipation in active bacterial clusters, offering new insights into the physical principles governing microbial cooperativity.",

      "abstract": "Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.",

      "abstract": "Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless; consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by ferroelectricity.",

      "abstract": "Capillary condensation of water is ubiquitous in nature and technology. It routinely occurs in granular and porous media, can strongly alter such properties as adhesion, lubrication, friction and corrosion, and is important in many processes employed by microelectronics, pharmaceutical, food and other industries. The century-old Kelvin equation is commonly used to describe condensation phenomena and shown to hold well for liquid menisci with diameters as small as several nm. For even smaller capillaries that are involved in condensation under ambient humidity and, hence, of particular practical interest, the Kelvin equation is expected to break down, because the required confinement becomes comparable to the size of water molecules. Here we take advantage of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals to create atomic-scale capillaries and study condensation inside. Our smallest capillaries are less than 4 angstroms in height and can accommodate just a monolayer of water. Surprisingly, even at this scale, the macroscopic Kelvin equation using the characteristics of bulk water is found to describe accurately the condensation transition in strongly hydrophilic (mica) capillaries and remains qualitatively valid for weakly hydrophilic (graphene) ones. We show that this agreement is somewhat fortuitous and can be attributed to elastic deformation of capillary walls, which suppresses giant oscillatory behavior expected due to commensurability between atomic-scale confinement and water molecules. Our work provides a much-needed basis for understanding of capillary effects at the smallest possible scale important in many realistic situations.",

However, optimizing the AEM design requires a deeper understanding of the ionic conduction mechanism in the hydrated polymer matrix. This study investigates this mechanism by seeking to understand the relationship between ion exchange capacity (IEC), water absorption, and ionic conductivity in polynorbornene-based thin films. We combine experimental measurements with computational simulations using a newly developed minimal model of the polymer film. Our model is able to reproduce key experimental observations, including water sorption isotherms and ion conduction behavior as a function of relative humidity, and successfully captures the relationship between them. By comparing experimental data with computational results, we explain the commonly reported correlation between conductivity and hydration level and show how the correlation between these variables is affected by the charge density and temperature of the material. Our research advances our understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern the performance of the polyelectrolyte membrane, which is essential for the development of more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly electrochemical systems.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning's application in solar-thermal desalination is limited by data shortage and inconsistent analysis. This study develops an optimized dataset collection and analysis process for the representative solar still. By ultra-hydrophilic treatment on the condensation cover, the dataset collection process reduces the collection time by 83.3%. Over 1,000 datasets are collected, which is nearly one order of magnitude larger than up-to-date works. Then, a new interdisciplinary process flow is proposed. Some meaningful results are obtained that were not addressed by previous studies. It is found that Radom Forest might be a better choice for datasets larger than 1,000 due to both high accuracy and fast speed. Besides, the dataset range affects the quantified importance (weighted value) of factors significantly, with up to a 115% increment. Moreover, the results show that machine learning has a high accuracy on the extrapolation prediction of productivity, where the minimum mean relative prediction error is just around 4%. The results of this work not only show the necessity of the dataset characteristics' effect but also provide a standard process for studying solar-thermal desalination by machine learning, which would pave the way for interdisciplinary study.",

      "abstract": "Recently, suction-based robotic systems with microscopic features or active suction components have been proposed to grip rough and irregular surfaces. However, sophisticated fabrication methods or complex control systems are required for such systems, and robust attachment to rough real-world surfaces still remains a grand challenge. Here, we propose a fully soft robotic gripper, where a flat elastic membrane is used to conform and contact parts or surfaces well, where an internal negative pressure exerted on the air-sealed membrane induces the suction-based gripping. 3D printing in combination with soft molding techniques enable the fabrication of the soft gripper. Robust attachment to complex 3D and rough surfaces is enabled by the surface-conformable soft flat membrane, which generates strong and robust suction at the contact interface. Such robust attachment to rough and irregular surfaces enables manipulation of a broad range of real-world objects, such as an egg, lime, and foiled package, without any physical damage. Compared to the conventional suction cup designs, the proposed suction gripper design shows a four-fold increase in gripping performance on rough surfaces. Furthermore, the structural and material simplicity of the proposed gripper architecture facilitates its system-level integration with other soft robotic peripherals, which can enable broader impact in diverse fields, such as digital manufacturing, robotic manipulation, and medical gripping applications.",

Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.",

The patterning of the substrate is obtained by using a monolithically integrated nano-channel alumina (NCA) mask and transferring its self-ordering to the underlying GaAs substrate by continuing the anodization process once the GaAs surface is reached. After patterning, the GaAs substrate follows a low temperature process for surface preparation before epitaxial growth for QD formation.

These effects are suppressed in noble metals with high symmetry and electron density. Introducing chiral structures can induce photomagnetic-chiral anisotropy (PM-ChA) of metals by linking chirality and spin dynamics. However, a theoretical explain remains elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanism of PM-ChA in tetrahelix-stacked chiral nanostructured gold chains (CNACs) using first-principles calculations. Non-equilibrium Green's function calculations reveal that chiral potentials enhance spin channel asymmetry by amplify-ing spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced spin splitting. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations further identify SOC as the bridge connecting chiral spintronics to PME, where chirality-driven spin flips from asymmetric geometries generate opposing photomagnetic fields in materials of different handedness. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in chiral nanostructured gold films and provide a theoretical instruction for design metallic spintronic devices.",

The ITR of the interfacial region was comparable in both the water and the ice states. As the nanostructure gaps became narrower, the ITR of the interfacial region decreased. The local ITR had a weak negative correlation with the local H2O molecule density regardless of the phase of the H2O molecules. The local ITR decreased as the local density increased. The greater amount of the thermal energy was transferred through the material interface by means of the intermolecular interaction when more the H2O molecules were located in the proximity area, which was closer to the Pt solid wall than the first adsorption layer peak. When the H2O molecules were in the crystal form on the solid wall, the proximity molecules decreased, and then the local ITR significantly increased.",

While techniques such as optical tweezers and atomic force microscopy can measure these properties, their reliance on localized probes prevents intracellular imaging and perturbs native cellular behaviour. Label-free microscopy offers a non-invasive alternative for observing intracellular dynamics. However, limitations in signal-to-noise ratio and imaging speed typically restrict analysis to diffusivity, leaving cellular viscous properties inaccessible. Here, we introduce rheoSCAT, a label-free, phase-sensitive microscope engineered with ultra-low phase noise. This system enables measurements of intracellular dynamics at frequencies up to 50 kHz, twenty times faster than previous label-free approaches. Applied to live cancer cells, this technique establishes a connection between label-free microscopy and rheology. The high speed of our technique reveals viscoelastic behaviours that were previously inaccessible, which we show are consistent with probe-based microrheology observations. The rheological images produced distinguish intra- and extracellular regions with high contrast, resolve spatial variations in cellular mechanics, and enable monitoring of cellular state and stress over time. The ability to quantitatively map intracellular energetics and viscoelasticity offers a powerful tool for advancing fundamental cell biology, cancer research, clinical diagnostics, and drug development.",

The intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple principal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways (5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale observations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect measurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive. Here, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic structure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy nuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that decreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As nuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce without misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain these experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways model, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through multiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only provide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but also offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other materials.",

      "abstract": "The van der Waals (vdW) dispersion interaction between two finite neutral objects typically follows the standard nonretarded $d^{-6}$ law. Here, we reveal an anomalous $d^{-10}$ scaling law between nanostructures with strong geometric or electric anisotropy, driven intrinsically by symmetry-restricted plasmon interactions. At finite anisotropy ratios, a scaling crossover from $d^{-10}$ to $d^{-6}$ occurs due to plasmon mode competition, marked by a finite critical separation. Furthermore, we demonstrate tunability of interlayer vdW forces in two-dimensional materials with strong in-plane electronic anisotropy. By pushing the conventional lower bound of vdW scaling laws, these findings open new opportunities for tailoring nanoscale forces, with potential applications in low-stiction nanomechanical devices, vdW superstructure assembly, metamaterials, and molecular simulations.",

      "abstract": "The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confined geometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law can be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement which is currently a subject of intense research activity.",

      "abstract": "Intuitively, prostheses with user-controllable stiffness could mimic the intrinsic behavior of the human musculoskeletal system, promoting safe and natural interactions and task adaptability in real-world scenarios. However, prosthetic design often disregards compliance because of the additional complexity, weight, and needed control channels. This paper focuses on designing a Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) with weight, size, and performance compatible with prosthetic applications, addressing its implementation for the elbow joint. While a direct biomimetic approach suggests adopting an Agonist-Antagonist (AA) layout to replicate the biceps and triceps brachii with elastic actuation, this solution is not optimal to accommodate the varied morphologies of residual limbs. Instead, we employed the AA layout to craft an elbow prosthesis fully contained in the user's forearm, catering to individuals with distal transhumeral amputations. Additionally, we introduce a variant of this design where the two motors are split in the upper arm and forearm to distribute mass and volume more evenly along the bionic limb, enhancing comfort for patients with more proximal amputation levels. We characterize and validate our approach, demonstrating that both architectures meet the target requirements for an elbow prosthesis. The system attains the desired 120{\\deg} range of motion, achieves the target stiffness range of [2, 60] Nm/rad, and can actively lift up to 3 kg. Our novel design reduces weight by up to 50% compared to existing VSAs for elbow prostheses while achieving performance comparable to the state of the art. Case studies suggest that passive and variable compliance could enable robust and safe interactions and task adaptability in the real world.",

      "abstract": "The thermal properties of an epoxy-based binary composites comprised of graphene and copper nanoparticles are reported. It is found that the \"synergistic\" filler effect, revealed as a strong enhancement of the thermal conductivity of composites with the size-dissimilar fillers, has a well-defined filler loading threshold. The thermal conductivity of composites with a moderate graphene concentration of ~15 wt% exhibits an abrupt increase as the loading of copper nanoparticles approaches ~40 wt%, followed by saturation. The effect is attributed to intercalation of spherical copper nanoparticles between the large graphene flakes, resulting in formation of the highly thermally conductive percolation network. In contrast, in composites with a high graphene concentration, ~40 wt%, the thermal conductivity increases linearly with addition of copper nanoparticles. The electrical percolation is observed at low graphene loading, less than 7 wt.%, owing to the large aspect ratio of graphene. At all concentrations of the fillers, below and above the electrical percolation threshold, the thermal transport is dominated by phonons. The obtained results shed light on the interaction between graphene fillers and copper nanoparticles in the composites and demonstrate potential of such hybrid epoxy composites for practical applications in thermal interface materials and adhesives.",

      "abstract": "Understanding oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries (GBs) is critical for controlling ionic conductivity in oxide ceramics. GBs are typically thought to enhance ionic transport due to structural disorder and increased free volume. In this study, we report an unexpected anomaly: the $\\Sigma 3(111)$ GB in thorium dioxide (ThO$_2$), despite its compact and coherent structure, exhibits significantly higher oxygen ionic conductivity compared to the more open GB ($\\Sigma 19$ as an example). Using atomistic simulations based on a machine learning interatomic potential, we revealed that the high conductivity in the $\\Sigma 3$ GB arises from a collective diffusion mechanism involving highly correlated atomic motion reminiscent of a superionic state. In contrast, the $\\Sigma 19$ GB follows conventional pipe diffusion, consistent with its more open structure. This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport. These findings provide new guidance for designing GB-engineered oxides with targeted ionic transport properties for energy applications.",

      "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a breakthrough in photovoltaic technology, combining high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), ease of fabrication, and tunable optoelectronic properties. However, their commercial viability is limited by critical issues such as charge carrier recombination, interfacial defects, instability under environmental stress, and toxicity of lead-based components. This review systematically examines recent advancements in charge carrier management strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations. Initially, fundamental mechanisms governing carrier generation, separation, transport, and recombination are outlined to provide a clear foundation. The study then delves into an in-depth analysis of carrier lifetime and mobility, evaluating recent methodologies for their enhancement through compositional engineering and structural optimization. Subsequently, trap state passivation techniques and interface engineering approaches are reviewed, with a particular focus on their impact on device stability and efficiency. The review also discusses long-term stability strategies and emerging trends in lead-free and scalable PSC technologies. In this work, recent strategies for charge carrier management are systematically categorized, comparative analyses are provided and synergistic solutions with high potential for real-world implementation are highlighted. By synthesizing data and perspectives from over thirty recent studies, this article offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers seeking to optimize PSC performance and accelerate their transition toward commercial application.",

      "abstract": "Silicon has long been the foundational semiconductor material for a broad range of electronic devices, owing to its numerous advantages: wide natural availability, ease of synthesis in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and relatively low production cost. However, despite these benefits, silicon is inherently limited in the field of optoelectronics due to its indirect bandgap, which results in low quantum efficiency for light emission, typically in the infrared region. One promising strategy to address this limitation is the development of nanocrystalline silicon, which consists of low-dimensional nanostructures such as quantum wires (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs). These structures exhibit enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence, primarily due to quantum confinement of excitons within the conduction and valence bands, leading to significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although research into these processes has spanned several decades, a definitive consensus on the mechanisms underlying photoluminescent emission in nanocrystalline silicon remains elusive. This work reviews two leading theoretical models proposed to explain this phenomenon and introduces a new, more comprehensive model that may provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of photoluminescence in nanocrystalline silicon. The new theory is applied in a case study.",

To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.",

X-ray diffraction examination verifies the structural integrity of the synthesized heterostructures (HTs). Optical and photoluminescence spectra were recorded to assess the variation in absorption and emission of the Ga$_2$O$_3$-coated HTs in comparison to the pristine ZnO. We conducted comparative density-functional theory (DFT) computations to corroborate the measured band gaps of both categories of HTs. To assess the stability of our devices, the transient response to on/off light switching under zero bias has been studied. The rise time $\\tau_{r1}$ ($\\tau_{r2}$) is 2300 (500) ms and the decay time $\\tau_{d1}$ ($\\tau_{d2}$) is 2700 (5000) ms have been observed for bare ZnO and ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$ HTs, respectively. A significant amount of change was also observed in the electrical transport properties from bare ZnO to ZnO/Ga$_2$O$_3$. To see the performance of device, responsivity (R) and detectivity (D = 1/NEP$_B$) have been measured. It is evident from observation that responsivity of a device shows maximum value in UV region while it is reducing with visible region for HTs. In case of detectivity, the maximum value reached was $145 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at ~ 200 nm) and $38 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz$^{1/2}$/W (at 300 nm) for Ga$_2$O$_3$ coated ZnO, and bare ZnO HTs, respectively.

      "abstract": "Background and Aim: Decellularized uterine extracellular matrix (dUECM) offers a promising bioactive scaffold for uterine tissue engineering, but its application in 3D constructs has been limited by fabrication challenges. This study aimed to develop a printable, bioactive hydrogel from dUECM suitable for 3D bioprinting and to evaluate its ability to support human uterine myometrial cell growth in vitro.   Materials and Methods: Porcine uterine tissues were decellularized using 1 percent Triton X-100 and 0.1 to 1.5 percent SDS for 48 to 72 hours. The resulting dUECM was assessed via histology, DNA and GAG quantification, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Selected dUECM samples were digested with pepsin and blended with 2 or 3 percent alginate to create bioinks. Constructs were printed using extrusion-based bioprinting and evaluated for swelling, degradation, mechanical properties, and printability. Biocompatibility was tested by seeding hTERT-HM cells onto cast hydrogels and performing MTT and Live/Dead assays over seven days.   Results: The optimal protocol (1 percent Triton X-100 and 1 percent SDS for 48 hours) reduced DNA to 51.3 ng per mg, while retaining 54.9 micrograms per mg of GAGs. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed collagen preservation, while thermal stability was moderately reduced. The 3 percent alginate with 1.5 percent dUECM formulation showed superior printability, swelling stability, degradation resistance, and mechanical strength. Cell proliferation reached 258 percent by day 7, significantly outperforming alginate alone.   Conclusion: The optimized dUECM hydrogel supports printability, mechanical performance, and cell viability, offering a robust platform for uterine tissue engineering.",

      "abstract": "Subdiffusion is a hallmark of complex systems, ranging from protein folding to transport in viscoelastic media. However, despite its pervasiveness, the mechanistic origins of subdiffusion remain contested. Here, we analyze both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, in the presence and absence of energy barriers, in order to disentangle the distinct contributions of memory-dependent friction and energy barriers to the emergence of subdiffusive behavior. Focusing on the mean squared displacement (MSD), we develop an analytical framework that connects subdiffusion to multiscale memory effects in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), and derive the subdiffusive scaling behavior of the MSD for systems governed by multi-exponential memory kernels. We identify persistence and relaxation timescales that delineate dynamical regimes in which subdiffusion arises from either memory or energy barrier effects. By comparing analytical predictions with simulations, we confirm that memory dominates the overdamped dynamics for barrier heights up to approximately $2\\,k_BT$, a regime recently shown to be relevant for protein folding. Overall, our results advance the theoretical understanding of anomalous diffusion and provide practical tools that are broadly applicable to fields as diverse as molecular biophysics, polymer physics, and active matter systems.",

      "abstract": "Engineering wear models are generally empirical and lack connections to the physical processes of debris generation at the nanoscale to microscale. Here, we thus analyze wear particle formation for sliding interfaces in dry contact with full and reduced adhesion. Depending on the material and interface properties and the local slopes of the surfaces, we find that colliding surface asperities can either deform plastically, form wear particles, or slip along the contact junction surface without significant damage. We propose a mechanism map as a function of material properties and local geometry, and confirm it using quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional molecular dynamics and finite-element simulations on an amorphous, siliconlike model material. The framework developed in the present paper conceptually ties the regimes of weak and strong interfacial adhesion together and can explain that even unlubricated sliding contacts do not necessarily lead to catastrophic wear rates. A salient result of the present paper is an analytical expression of a critical length scale, which incorporates interface properties and roughness parameters. Therefore, our findings provide a theoretical framework and a quantitative map to predict deformation mechanisms at individual contacts. In particular, contact junctions of sizes above the critical length scale contribute to the debris formation.",

Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies four independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.",

      "abstract": "Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.",

The forces involved in thread deployment and interactions among mucus and threads are key to understanding how hagfish slime rapidly assembles into a cohesive, functional network. Despite extensive interest in its biophysical properties, the mechanical forces governing thread deployment and interaction remain poorly quantified. Here, we present the first direct in situ measurements of the micromechanical forces involved in hagfish slime formation, including mucus mechanical properties, skein peeling force, thread-mucus adhesion, and thread-thread cohesion. Using a custom glass-rod force sensing system, we show that thread deployment initiates when peeling forces exceed a threshold of approximately 6.8 nN. To understand the flow strength required for unraveling, we used a rheo-optic setup to impose controlled shear flow, enabling us to directly observe unraveling dynamics and determine the critical shear rate for unraveling of the skeins, which we then interpreted using an updated peeling-based force balance model. Our results reveal that thread-mucus adhesion dominates over thread-thread adhesion and that deployed threads contribute minimally to bulk shear rheology at constant flow rate. These findings clarify the physics underlying the rapid, flow-triggered assembly of hagfish slime and inform future designs of synthetic deployable fiber-gel systems.",

Therefore, effective modulation of $\\kappa_l$ can be achieved through selective manipulation of phonon modes that strongly participate in the heat transport mechanisms. Here, combining accurate first-principles density functional theory calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, we report a layered quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor, BaCuGdTe$_3$, which exhibits unusually low $\\kappa_l$ ($\\sim$ 0.14 W/mK at room temperature) despite its ordered crystalline structure. Our analysis reveals that the ultralow $\\kappa_l$ arises mainly from a strong suppression of acoustic phonon modes induced by local distortion, shear vibrations among the layers, and large acoustic-optical avoided-crossing between phonons, which collectively enhances the phonon-scattering rates. Further calculations of the electrical transport properties with explicit consideration of electron-phonon interactions reveal a high thermoelectric figure of merit exceeding unity for this compound at moderate temperature (400-700 K) and carrier concentration $(1\\text{--}5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\text{cm}^{-3})$ ranges. Our theoretical predictions warrant experimental investigations of the intriguing phonon dynamics, thermal transport mechanisms, and thermoelectric properties in this compound. Moreover, insights from our analysis can be used to design and engineer compounds with ultralow $\\kappa_l$.",

Understanding adhesion of particle contamination is key in devising a strategy for cleaning of photomasks. In this work, particle contamination is treated as a particle-plane problem in which surface roughness and the interacting materials have major influences. For this purpose, we perform vacuum atomic force microscopy (AFM) contact measurements to quantify the van der Waals (vdW) forces between tip and sample. We introduce this as a vacuum AFM-based methodology that combines numerical Hamaker theory and Blind Tip Reconstruction (BTR). We have determined the Hamaker constants of $15x10^{-20} J$ and $13x10^{-20} J$ for the material systems of a silicon (Si) tip with both aluminum oxide ($Al_{2}O_{3}$) and native silicon dioxide ($SiO_{2}$) on Si substrates, respectively.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a shear-based control scheme for grasping and manipulating delicate objects with a Pisa/IIT anthropomorphic SoftHand equipped with soft biomimetic tactile sensors on all five fingertips. These `microTac' tactile sensors are miniature versions of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor, and can extract precise contact geometry and force information at each fingertip for use as feedback into a controller to modulate the grasp while a held object is manipulated. Using a parallel processing pipeline, we asynchronously capture tactile images and predict contact pose and force from multiple tactile sensors. Consistent pose and force models across all sensors are developed using supervised deep learning with transfer learning techniques. We then develop a grasp control framework that uses contact force feedback from all fingertip sensors simultaneously, allowing the hand to safely handle delicate objects even under external disturbances. This control framework is applied to several grasp-manipulation experiments: first, retaining a flexible cup in a grasp without crushing it under changes in object weight; second, a pouring task where the center of mass of the cup changes dynamically; and third, a tactile-driven leader-follower task where a human guides a held object. These manipulation tasks demonstrate more human-like dexterity with underactuated robotic hands by using fast reflexive control from tactile sensing.",

      "abstract": "Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.",

      "abstract": "Phyllosilicate clays have diverse applications in packaging industries and are found highly suitable for formulation, including thermoplastic starch (TPS), polyethylene (PE), or their combination. We developed CG MARTINI-3 parameters of the pyrophyllite using Lifshitz theory and experimental surface tension data. These initial bead assignments of pyrophyllite and periodic tetramethylammonium-montmorillonite (TMA-MMT) sheet were fine-tuned using optimal reproduction of structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties obtained via all-atom (AA) simulation of TPS with a periodic pyrophyllite sheet. These developed models predicted the correct AA radial distribution function and two-body excess entropy for polymer-sorbitol pairs, showcasing the robustness of the developed CG model in predicting the properties not used in parameterization. These composite simulations revealed acceleration (for pyrophyllite) or retardation (for TMA-MMT) of khun segment dynamics (compared to melt) with the depletion of polymer near the surface. The developed CG parameters were used to investigate the long-time behavior of TPS-polyethylene (PE) melt and their Cloisite-15A-based composite systems. The coordination number indicated compatibilization of the TPS-PE phase, achieved by binding TPS through its bare polar surface and PE via alkyl-mediated interactions, which consequently reduced the TPS-PE interfacial surface tension from 45 mN/m to 13.06 mN/m. Additionally, high TPS-clay coordination, sustained localization of clay at the TPS-PE interface, and clay aggregation observed in CG simulation closely agree with experimental observations. Further, the CG model effectively captured the clay-mediated variation in the overall morphology of the TPS-PE system and their direct impact on chain conformational properties, making this CG model highly suitable for a material design perspective.",

      "abstract": "Developing robotic hands that adapt to real-world dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and machine intelligence. Despite significant advances in replicating human hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (p<0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering new perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behavior.",

      "abstract": "We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the CRL2RT algorithm, an advanced reinforcement learning method aimed at improving the real-time control performance of the Direct-Drive Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform (DDTWEP). Inspired by dragonfly flight, DDTWEP's tandem wing structure causes nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic interactions, leading to complex load behaviors during pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers. These complexities challenge stable motion control at high frequencies (2000 Hz). To overcome these issues, we developed the CRL2RT algorithm, which combines classical control elements with reinforcement learning-based controllers using a time-interleaved architecture and a rule-based policy composer. This integration ensures finite-time convergence and single-life adaptability. Experimental results under various conditions, including different flapping frequencies and yaw disturbances, show that CRL2RT achieves a control frequency surpassing 2500 Hz on standard CPUs. Additionally, when integrated with classical controllers like PID, Adaptive PID, and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), CRL2RT enhances tracking performance by 18.3% to 60.7%. These findings demonstrate CRL2RT's broad applicability and superior performance in complex real-time control scenarios, validating its effectiveness in overcoming existing control strategy limitations and advancing robust, efficient real-time control for biomimetic aerial vehicles.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we study the effect of various deposition methods for phosphonic acid interface modifiers commonly pursued as self-assembled monolayers in high-performance metal halide perovskite photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. We compare the deposition of (2-(3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid onto indium tin oxide (ITO) bottom contacts by varying three parameters: the method of deposition, specifically spin coating or prolonged dip coating, ITO surface treatment via HCl/FeCl3 etching, and use in combination with a second modifier, 1,6-hexylenediphosphonic acid. We demonstrate that varying these modification protocols can impact time-resolved photoluminescence carrier lifetimes and quasi-Fermi level splitting of perovskite films deposited onto the phosphonic-acid-modified ITO. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows an increase in effective work function after phosphonic acid modification and clear evidence for photoemission from carbazole functional groups at the ITO surface. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe differences in phosphonic acid coverage on the metal oxide contact and show that perovskite samples grown on ITO with the highest phosphonic acid coverage exhibit the longest carrier lifetimes. Finally, we establish that device performance follows these same trends. These results indicate that the reactivity, heterogeneity, and composition of the bottom contact help to control recombination rates and therefore power conversion efficiencies. ITO etching, prolonged deposition times for phosphonic acids via dip coating, and the use of a secondary, more hydrophilic bis-phosphonic acid, all contribute to improvements in surface coverage, carrier lifetime, and device efficiency. These improvements each have a positive impact, and we achieve the best results when all three strategies are implemented.",

We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.",

Boundary conditions of structures are crucial to predict and control their snap-buckling behavior. However, the general framework that relates boundary conditions, geometry, and performance of structures is still absent to date. Here, we study the snap-buckling of hemispherical shells in contact with rigid cylinders of different diameters to uncover the roles of boundary conditions in the dynamic performance of shells. Specifically, we analyze the jumping dynamics of the pneumatically inverted shells placed on the rigid cylinder by combining experiments and analytical theory. We find the characteristic diameter classifying the snap-buckling and jumping dynamics into two: (i)~if the diameter of the cylinder is sufficiently larger than the characteristic diameter, the shell is regarded as in contact with the infinitely large flat plate, (ii)~if not, the cylinder is regarded as a point. The analytical predictions for the jumping performance of the shell supplemented with the characteristic diameter are in excellent agreement with our experimental results. Our study clarifies that contact geometry is crucial in predicting the pathway of snap-buckling, indicating that the dynamic performance of soft robots would be optimized by tuning their surface geometry.",

Existing theoretical models often fail to accurately capture the experimental data, due to non-physical assumptions that link the molecule kinematics with the macroscopic deformation. In this work, we construct a novel Hamiltonian for chain segments enabling a unified statistical description of both individual macromolecular chains and continuum polymer networks. The chain kinematics, including the stretch and orientation properties, are retrieved by the thermodynamic observables without phenomenological assumptions. The theory shows that the chain stretch is specified by a simple relation via its current spatial direction and the continuum Eulerian logarithmic strain, while the probability of a chain in this spatial direction is governed by the new Hamiltonian of a single segment. The model shows a significantly improved prediction on the hyperelastic response of elastomers, relying on minimal, physically-grounded parameters.",

For example, nacre -- formed by mollusks in the ocean -- encodes local environmental conditions throughout its formation and has exceptional strength due to its nanoscale brick-and-mortar structure. This layered structure, comprising transparent aragonite tablets bonded with an ultra-thin organic polymer, also results in stunning interference colors. Existing methods of structural characterization of nacre rely on some form of cross-sectional analysis, such as scanning electron microscopy or polarization-dependent imaging contrast (PIC) mapping. However, these techniques are destructive and too time- and resource-intensive to analyze large sample areas. Here we present an all-optical, rapid, and non-destructive imaging technique -- hyperspectral interference tomography (HIT) -- to spatially map the structural parameters of nacre and other disordered layered materials. We combined hyperspectral imaging with optical-interference modeling to infer the mean tablet thickness and disordering of nacre layers across entire mollusk shells at various stages of development, observing a previously unknown relationship between the growth of the mollusk and tablet thickness. Our rapid, inexpensive, and nondestructive method can be readily applied to in-field studies.",

      "title": "Coordination-Driven Classification and Energetic Scaling of Boron   Fullerenes and Borophene",
      "abstract": "We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = -a/n^b + E_c^{\\mathrm{sheet}}$, with $b = 0.4$ or $b = 0.9$ depending on the coordination family, captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\\chi^3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. Our analysis reveals two distinct families of boron nanostructures based on the scaling exponent: one with $b = 0.9$, comprising structures with significant 6-fold coordination, and another with $b = 0.4$, which includes B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, and two experimentally observed borophenes. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO--LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$~eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14~eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3\\mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.",

      "abstract": "Novel robotic grippers have captured increasing interests recently because of their abilities to adapt to varieties of circumstances and their powerful functionalities. Differing from traditional gripper with mechanical components-made fingers, novel robotic grippers are typically made of novel structures and materials, using a novel manufacturing process. In this paper, a novel robotic gripper with external frame and internal thermoplastic elastomer belt-made net is proposed. The gripper grasps objects using the friction between the net and objects. It has the ability of adaptive gripping through flexible contact surface. Stress simulation has been used to explore the regularity between the normal stress on the net and the deformation of the net. Experiments are conducted on a variety of objects to measure the force needed to reliably grip and hold the object. Test results show that the gripper can successfully grip objects with varying shape, dimensions, and textures. It is promising that the gripper can be used for grasping fragile objects in the industry or out in the field, and also grasping the marine organisms without hurting them.",

      "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries employing solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are emerging as a safer and more compact alternative to conventional batteries using liquid electrolytes, especially for miniaturized energy storage systems. However, the industry-standard SSE, LiPON, imposes limitations due to its incompatibility with high-temperature processing. In this study, we investigate Li$_{4-x}$Ge$_{1-x}$P$_x$O$_4$ (LGPO), a LISICON-type oxide, as a promising alternative thin-film SSE. LGPO thin films are fabricated using pulsed laser deposition under four distinct deposition conditions, with in situ impedance spectroscopy enabling precise conductivity measurements without ambient exposure. We systematically correlate deposition temperature, background pressure, chemical composition, crystallinity, and morphology with ionic transport properties. Polycrystalline LGPO films grown at high temperature (535 $^\\circ$C) and low oxygen pressure (0.01 mbar) exhibited the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity ($\\sim 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$ S cm$^{-1}$), exceeding that of LiPON by an order of magnitude, with an activation energy of 0.46 eV. In contrast, amorphous films show significantly lower conductivity ($\\sim 5.2 \\times 10^{-8}$ S cm$^{-1}$) and higher activation energy (0.72 eV). The results reveal that crystallinity, chemical composition, and grain boundary density critically affect ion transport, highlighting the importance of microstructural control. This work establishes LGPO as a viable, high-performance oxide SSE compatible with high-temperature processing for next-generation microbattery architectures.",

      "abstract": "Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for future applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.",

      "abstract": "There is a trend in research towards more automation using smart systems powered by artificial   intelligence. While experiments are often challenging to automate, they can greatly benefit from   automation by reducing labor and increasing reproducibility. For example, optical tweezers are   widely employed in single-molecule biophysics, cell biomechanics, and soft matter physics, but they   still require a human operator, resulting in low throughput and limited repeatability. Here, we   present a smart optical tweezers platform, which we name SmartTrap, capable of performing complex   experiments completely autonomously. SmartTrap integrates real-time 3D particle tracking using   deep learning, custom electronics for precise feedback control, and a microfluidic setup for particle   handling. We demonstrate the ability of SmartTrap to operate continuously, acquiring high-precision   data over extended periods of time, through a series of experiments. By bridging the gap between   manual experimentation and autonomous operation, SmartTrap establishes a robust and open source   framework for the next generation of optical tweezers research, capable of performing large-scale   studies in single-molecule biophysics, cell mechanics, and colloidal science with reduced experimental   overhead and operator bias.",

      "abstract": "Recent experiments on amorphous materials have established the existence of surface states similar to those of crystalline three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). Amorphous topological insulators are also independently of interest for thermo-electric and other properties. To develop an understanding of transport in these systems, we carry out quantum transport calculations for a tight-binding model of an amorphous nano-wire pierced by an axial magnetic flux, then compare the results to known features in the case of crystalline models with disorder. Our calculations complement previous studies in the crystalline case that studied the surface or used a Green's function method. We find that the periodicity of the conductance signal with varying magnetic flux is comparable to the crystalline case, with maxima occurring at odd multiples of magnetic flux quanta. However, the expected amplitude of the oscillation decreases with increasing amorphousness, as defined and described in the main text. We characterize this deviation from the crystalline case by taking ensemble averages of the conductance signatures for various wires with measurements simulated at finite temperatures. This striking transport phenomenon offers a metric to characterize amorphous TIs and stimulate further experiments on this class of materials.",

      "abstract": "Traditional surface cleaning methods often suffer from drawbacks such as chemical harshness, potential for surface damage, and high energy consumption. This study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface cleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation frequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of these bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for 1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same size. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary bubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined surface display pronounced \"stop-and-go\" dynamics. The theoretical model treats the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension provides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic added mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed resonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning efficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was improved by approximately 90\\% when bubbles were driven at their translational resonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic conditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance enhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and sustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.",

It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.",

      "abstract": "Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.",

We assume in particular that the rest length has a linear force-velocity relation, and that the force and rest length are both zero at the moment of crossbridge attachment. Crossbridges that are not attached in our model have a fixed probability per unit time of attachment, and attached crossbridges have a probability per unit time of detachment that is a function of the crossbridge force. This detachment rate is uniquely determined by the requirement that a limiting form of the model should reproduce the force-velocity curve and heat of shortening discovered by A.V.Hill~\\cite{AVHILL}, and the detachment rate turns out to be a linearly decreasing function of the crossbridge force. The parameters of the model are determined by a fit to steady-state experimental data; and then an event-driven stochastic simulation methodology is introduced in order to study the behavior of the model in a simulated quick-release experiment. The model explains how the crossbridge can act like a linear spring on a fast time scale but have very different properties on a slower time scale.",

We successfully detected vibrational TE-SFG signals from adsorbed molecules on a gold substrate under ambient conditions. The phase analysis of interferometric SFG spectra provided information on molecular orientation. Furthermore, the observed TE-SFG signal was confirmed to originate from a highly localized region within a gap between the tip apex and the sample substrate.

The proposed design achieves ultranarrow resonance linewidths with the spectral tuning range exceeding 60 nm while maintaining a constant quality factor. This tuning capability, realized through both horizontal displacement within a 1D metasurface and vertical MEMS membrane movement, offers a new degree of freedom for manipulating quasi-BIC resonances. The proposed hybridization of 2D and 1D metasurfaces using MEMS mechanism provides a practical route to dynamic modulation of transmission resonance characteristics, making it a promising candidate for tunable filters, spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing applications.",

In this example, the dynamics is characterized by apparently futile time histories in which microtubules repeatedly grow and shrink without chromosomal attachment. We hypothesize that for biological processes for which it is not the initial conditions that matter, but rather the final state, this kind of exploratory dynamics is biology's unique and necessary solution to achieving these functions with high fidelity. This kind of cause and effect relationship can be contrasted to examples from physics and chemistry where the initial conditions determine the outcome. In this paper, we examine the similarities of many biological processes that depend upon random trajectories starting from the initial state and the selection of subsets of these trajectories to achieve some desired functional final state. We begin by reviewing the long history of the principles of dynamics, first in the context of physics, and then in the context of the study of life. These ideas are then stacked against the broad categories of biological phenomenology that exhibit exploratory dynamics. We then build on earlier work by making a quantitative examination of a succession of increasingly sophisticated models for exploratory dynamics, all of which share the common feature of being a series of repeated trials that ultimately end in a \"winning\" trajectory. We also explore the ways in which microscopic parameters can be tuned to alter exploratory dynamics as well as the energetic burden of performing such processes.",

      "abstract": "Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\\chi$ and packing fractions $\\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.",

      "abstract": "Dielectrophoretic (DEP) sensing is an extremely important sensing modality that enables the rapid capture and detection of polarizable particles of nano-scale size. This makes it a versatile tool for applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and materials science. Because DEP relies upon the creation of sharp electrode edges, its sensitivity is fundamentally limited by the electrode thickness. Graphene, with its monolayer thickness, enables scaling of the DEP force, allowing trapping of particles at graphene edges at ultra-low voltages. However, to date, this enhanced trapping efficiency of graphene has not been translated into an effective sensing geometry. Here, we demonstrate the expansion of graphene DEP trapping capability into a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) geometry that allows the trapped particles to be electrically detected. This four-terminal multi-functional hybrid device structure operates in three distinct modes: DEP, GFET, and DEP-GFET. By segmenting the channel of the GFET into multiple parallel channels, greatly increased density of particle trapping is demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy analysis. We show further enhancement of the trapping efficiency using engineered \"nano-sites,\" which are holes in the graphene with size on the order of 200-300 nm. Scanning electron microscope analysis of immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) shows trapping efficiency >90% for properly engineered nano-sites. Using nano-site trapping, we also demonstrate real-time, rapid electrical sensing of AuNPs, with >2% current change occurring in 4.1 seconds, as well as rapid sensing of a variety of biomolecule-coated nanoparticles. This work shows that graphene DEP is an effective platform for nanoparticle and bio-molecule sensing that overcomes diffusion-limited and Brownian motion-based interactions.",

      "abstract": "The reversible semiconductor-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide (VO2) makes VO2-based coatings a promising candidate for thermochromic smart windows, reducing the energy consumption of buildings. We report low-temperature (320 degC) depositions of thermochromic V1-x-yWxSryO2 films with a thickness of 71-73 nm onto 170-175 nm thick Y-stabilized ZrO2 layers on a 1 mm thick conventional soda-lime glass. The developed deposition technique is based on reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow feedback control allowing us to prepare crystalline W and Sr co-doped VO2 films of the required stoichiometry without any substrate bias or post-deposition annealing. The W doping of VO2 decreases the transition temperature below 25 degC, while the Sr doping of VO2 increases the integral luminous transmittance, Tlum, significantly due to widening of the visible-range optical band gap, which is consistent with lowering of the absorption coefficient of films. We present the discussion of the effect of the Sr content in the metal sublattice of VO2 on the electronic and crystal structure of V1-x-yWxSryO2 films, and on their temperature-dependent optical and electrical properties. An optimized V0.855W0.018Sr0.127O2 film exhibits a high Tlum = 56.8% and modulation of the solar energy transmittance deltaTsol = 8.3%, which are 1.50 times and 1.28 times, respectively, higher compared with those of the V0.984W0.016O2 film. The achieved results constitute an important step toward a low-temperature synthesis of large-area thermochromic VO2-based coatings for future smart-window applications, as it is easy to further increase the Tlum and deltaTsol by >6% and >3%, respectively, using a 280 nm thick top SiO2 antireflection layer.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents Duawlfin, a drone with unified actuation for wheeled locomotion and flight operation that achieves efficient, bidirectional ground mobility. Unlike existing hybrid designs, Duawlfin eliminates the need for additional actuators or propeller-driven ground propulsion by leveraging only its standard quadrotor motors and introducing a differential drivetrain with one-way bearings. This innovation simplifies the mechanical system, significantly reduces energy usage, and prevents the disturbance caused by propellers spinning near the ground, such as dust interference with sensors. Besides, the one-way bearings minimize the power transfer from motors to propellers in the ground mode, which enables the vehicle to operate safely near humans. We provide a detailed mechanical design, present control strategies for rapid and smooth mode transitions, and validate the concept through extensive experimental testing. Flight-mode tests confirm stable aerial performance comparable to conventional quadcopters, while ground-mode experiments demonstrate efficient slope climbing (up to 30{\\deg}) and agile turning maneuvers approaching 1g lateral acceleration. The seamless transitions between aerial and ground modes further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of our approach for applications like urban logistics and indoor navigation.

      "abstract": "The interaction of light with optical and mechanical systems is influenced by material properties, geometrical configurations, and surface topographies. Designing these systems necessitates a careful balance of conflicting requirements, such as minimising size and weight while simultaneously improving heat transfer and reducing stray light from illuminated peripheral mounting surfaces. Stray light is typically mitigated by apertures, coatings, and microscopic structures, alongside maintaining cleanliness. However, using apertures may not always be feasible, and effective optical absorber coatings or microscopic light absorbing structures can be costly and sensitive to environmental factors such as abrasion, radiation heating, or cleaning agents.   In a proof-of-concept investigation, we design and analyse macroscopic structural light absorbers realised as periodic minimal surface approximations and quasi-stochastic lattices. The term \"macroscopic\" refers to minimal structural dimensions of approximately 100 micrometres. By increasing the number of reflections before residual reflected light reaches a hemispherical receiver, we achieve reductions in received peak intensities by factors of less than 0.39 and average intensities by factors of less than 0.65, without altering the surface properties.   Macroscopic structural light absorbers support cost-effective and robust light-absorbing materials, such as black anodised aluminium or ABS polymers, while still achieving satisfactory stray light suppression. This approach is applicable to aerospace optical systems (such as telescopes and imaging spectrometers), as well as general scientific and industrial optical instruments and commercial products (including projectors and luminaires). The demonstrated structures can be sustainably fabricated through additive manufacturing processes like laser powder bed fusion.",

      "abstract": "We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.",

For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.",

However, long relaxation times and large system size requirements limit the application to systems of practical interest. In this work, we have developed a coarse-grained (CG) model of organically modified MMT (oMMT) compatible with the MARTINI force field, a chemically-specific interaction model with high transferability. The dispersive and polar components of cleavage energy, basal spacing, and mechanical properties of MMT with tetramethylammonium (TMA) as intergallery ions were used to obtain a rational estimate for clay particle MARTINI bead types in accordance with the polarity of the functional group. The CG model provided accurate concurrent estimates for the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of PE in a PE/TMA-MMT PCNC, with less than 4% deviation from all atom (AA) simulations. The slow clay-induced redistribution of the PE-b-PEG block copolymer in the PCNCs was investigated using the developed CG model, with conformational changes occurring over a microsecond timescale. The preferential interaction coefficient and cluster analysis of individual blocks of PE-b-PEG were used to study the effect of clay arrangement (exfoliated versus tactoid) on copolymer reorientation and assembly at the clay surface. We find that the oMMT coated with PE-b-PEG acts as a neutral surface (small difference in polymer-polymer and polymer-oMMT+PE-b-PEG enthalpic interactions) and the primary influence of the nanofiller is a result of confinement and steric effect of the clay sheets on the PE chains.",

In this experimental study, we demonstrate the feasibility of engineering and actively controlling cavity modes, as well as tuning their mutual coupling, in an ENZ multilayer structure. Specifically, by employing a high-birefringence liquid crystal film as a tunable nanocavity, the polarization-dependent coupling of resonant modes with narrow spectral width and spatial extent was achieved. Surface forces aparatus (SFA) allowed us to continuously and precisely control the thickness of the liquid crystal film contained between the nanocavities and thus vary the detuning between the cavity modes. Hence, we were able to manipulate nanocavities anti-crossing behaviors. The suggested methodology unlocks the full potential of tunable optical coupling in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials and provides a versatile approach to the creation of tunable photonic devices, including bio-photonic sensors, and/or tunable planar metamaterials for on-chip spectrometers.",

We also derive a general quasistatic bound on the work, relying only on the coarse-grained, time-integrated characteristics of the applied forces. Notably, we show that the optimal protocols often automatically act as information engines that harness information about non-equilibrium forces and an initial state measurement to extract work. These findings chart new directions for designing adaptive, energy-efficient strategies in noisy, time-dependent environments, as illustrated through our examples of periodic driving forces and active matter systems.

In this study, we developed a low-temperature STP and demonstrated its performance on monoatomic metal films formed on Si(111) substrates that were prepared in-situ. Stable operation at low temperatures enables us to extract the electrochemical potential originating from the surface transport by canceling out the potential due to thermal differences and artifacts arising from the nonlinearity of the density of states (DOS). We also formulated the nonlinear-DOS artifact and confirmed it by comparing with the nonlinearity obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.",

      "abstract": "Multi-functional materials are increasingly essential in many applications due to their ability to serve multiple purposes, simultaneously. Metamaterials can offer tailored functionality based on carefully designed tessellating basic building blocks, or unit cells, in space. These unit cells are most commonly designed for a single objective, for example, to mitigate an impact, insulate sound, or dampen vibrations. However, a metamaterial that can mitigate impact, attenuate elastic vibrations, insulate airborne sound, while being ultra-light and ultra-stiff remains elusive. Here, we present three gyroid-based metamaterial designs, which are numerically and experimentally examined, that can simultaneously serve all these functions in all directions. Our designs have band gaps reaching 60% with as low as 367 Hz starting band gap frequency, while being up to 77% lighter than a homogeneous block of the same material. Our findings highlight the potential of metamaterials for applications that require wave manipulation, mechanical resilience, and impact mitigation with limited mass and volume, simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "Elastomeric pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form adhesive bonds under light pressure. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are exciting PSA candidates as they can impart both anisotropy and temperature-dependence to adhesion, but the full potential of their anisotropic adhesion is unexplored. Here, identical side-chain LCEs, produced as transparent isotropic or nematic films are investigated; the latter aligned in homeotropic or planar geometries. Their room-temperature adhesion, determined through a 90-degree peel test, is consistent with theoretical predictions and strongest in a planar geometry (peeled parallel to the director) with adhesive force per unit length of 0.67 Nmm-1. In contrast, adhesion of the planar perpendicular, isotropic and homeotropic films is 62.5%, 38.5% and 23.0% lower, respectively. The surface contribution to adhesion is identical for all films, confirming that the variation in adhesion is determined solely by the bulk LCE alignment controlled during film preparation. A temperature-dependent adhesion factor is determined from 0 Celsius to 80 Celsius using dynamic mechanical analysis, and found to be in excellent agreement with the peel data at room temperature. Molecular relaxations active above the glass transition temperature are dominant in determining LCE adhesion. The results show that side-chain LCEs can function as transparent, tunable, broad-temperature smart PSAs",

By employing a \"remote salt\" strategy, precise control over NaCl supply was achieved, enabling the growth of high-quality coaxial NbS2 nanotubes on single-walled carbon nanotube-boron nitride nanotube (SWCNT-BNNT) templates. With the remote salt strategy, the morphologies of as synthesized NbS2 could be controlled from 1D nanotubes to suspended 2D flakes. Structural characterization via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the formation of crystalline NbS2 nanotubes, revealing a distinct bi-layer preference compared to monolayer-dominated semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide analogs. Optical analyses using UV-vis-NIR and FTIR spectroscopy highlight the metallic nature of NbS2. With Raman analysis, oxidation studies demonstrate relative higher degradation rate of 1D NbS2 under ambient conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the stabilization mechanism of bi-layer NbS2 nanotubes, emphasizing interlayer charge transfer and Coulomb interactions. This work establishes a robust framework for synthesizing metallic 1D vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications in optoelectronics and nanodevices.",

      "abstract": "Flagellar-driven locomotion plays a critical role in bacterial attachment and colonization of surfaces, contributing to the risks of contamination and infection. Tremendous attempts to uncover the underlying principles governing bacterial motility near surfaces have relied on idealized assumptions of surrounding inorganic boundaries. However, in the context of living systems, the role of cells from tissues and organs becomes increasingly critical, particularly in bacterial swimming and adhesion, yet it remains poorly understood. Here, we propose using biological surfaces composed of vascular endothelial cells to experimentally investigate bacterial motion and interaction behaviors. Our results reveal that bacterial trapping observed on inorganic surfaces is counteractively manifested with reduced radii of circular motion on cellular surfaces, while with two distinct modes of bacterial adhesion: tight adhesion and loose adhesion. Interestingly, the presence of living cells enhances bacterial surface enrichment, and imposed flow intensifies this accumulation via bias-swimming effect. These results surprisingly indicate that physical effects remain the dominant factor regulating bacterial motility and accumulation at the single-cell layer level in vitro, bridging the gap between simplified hydrodynamic mechanisms and complex biological surfaces, with relevance to biofilm formation and bacterial contamination.",

      "abstract": "The dry release transfer of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, h-BN, and TMDs is a versatile method for fabricating high-quality van der Waals heterostructures. Up until now, polydimethylpolysiloxane (PDMS) sheets have been widely used for the dry release transfer of TMD materials. However, this method has been known to have limitations that make it difficult to transfer few-layer-thick graphene and h-BN because of the difficulty to fabricate these materials on PDMS. As an alternative method, we demonstrate the dry release transfer of single- and bi-layer graphene and few-layer h-BN in this study by utilizing poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) films. Because of the strong adhesion between PPC and 2D materials around room temperature, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene, as well as few-layer h-BN, can be fabricated on a spin-coated PPC film/290-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate via the mechanical exfoliation method. In addition, we show that these few-layer crystals are clearly distinguishable using an optical microscope with the help of optical interference. Because of the thermoplastic properties of PPC film, the adhesion force between the 2D materials and PPC significantly decreases at about 70 {\\deg}C. Therefore, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene, as well as few-layer h-BN flakes, on PPC can be easily dry-transferred onto another h-BN substrate. This method enables a multilayer van der Waals heterostructure to be constructed with a minimum amount of polymer contamination. We demonstrate the fabrication of encapsulated h-BN/graphene/h-BN devices and graphene/few-layer h-BN/graphene vertical-tunnel-junction devices using this method. Since devices fabricated by this method do not require an edge-contact scheme, our finding provide a simples method for constructing high-quality graphene and h-BN-based van der Waals heterostructures.",

      "abstract": "Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology.Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror and time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Hence they do not lead to a field-driven photocurrent individually, but when superposed can break individual symmetries and generate photocurrents. For unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase the tailored light exhibits TRS while breaking all other crystal symmetries, which imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems as we show both theoretically and experimentally. We employ state-of-the-art \\textit{ab-initio} simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.",

Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.",

      "abstract": "Low-dimensional materials hold great promises for exploring emergent physical phenomena, nanoelectronics, and quantum technologies. Their synthesis often depends on catalytic metal films, from which the synthesized materials must be transferred to insulating substrates to enable device functionality and minimize interfacial interactions during quantum investigations. Conventional transfer methods, such as chemical etching or electrochemical delamination, degrade material quality, limit scalability, or prove incompatible with complex device architectures. Here, a scalable, etch-free transfer technique is presented, employing Field's metal (51% In, 32.5% Bi, and 16.5% Sn by weight) as a low-melting-point mechanical support to gently delaminate low-dimensional materials from metal films without causing damage. Anchoring the metal film during separation prevents tearing and preserves material integrity. As a proof of concept, atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are transferred from Au(111)/mica to dielectric substrates, including silicon dioxide (SiO_2) and single-crystalline lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl). Comprehensive characterization confirms the preservation of structural and chemical integrity throughout the transfer process. Wafer-scale compatibility and device integration are demonstrated by fabricating GNR-based field-effect transistors (GNRFETs) that exhibit room-temperature switching with on/off current ratios exceeding 10^3. This method provides a scalable and versatile platform for integrating low-dimensional materials into advanced low-dimensional materials-based technologies.",

      "abstract": "Two experimental studies reported the spontaneous formation of amorphous and crystalline structures of C60 intercalated between graphene and a substrate. They observed interesting phenomena ranging from reaction between C60 molecules under graphene to graphene sagging between the molecules and control of strain in graphene. Motivated by these works, we performed fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations to study the formation and thermal stability of graphene wrinkles as well as graphene attachment to and detachment from the substrate when graphene is laid over a previously distributed array of C60 molecules on a copper substrate at different values of temperature. As graphene compresses the C60 molecules against the substrate, and graphene attachment to the substrate between C60s (\"C60s\" stands for plural of C60) depends on the height of graphene wrinkles, configurations with both frozen and non-frozen C60s structures were investigated in order to verify the experimental result of stable sagged graphene when the distance between C60s is about 4 nm and height of graphene wrinkles is about 0.8 nm. Below the distance of 4 nm between C60s, graphene becomes locally suspended and less strained. We show that this happens when C60s are allowed to deform under the compressive action of graphene. If we keep the C60s frozen, spontaneous \"blanketing\" of graphene happens only when the distance between them are equal or above 7 nm. Both above results for the existence of stable sagged graphene for C60 distances of 4 or 7 nm are shown to agree with a mechanical model relating the rigidity of graphene to the energy of graphene-substrate adhesion. In particular, this study might help the development of 2D confined nanoreactors that are considered in literature to be the next advanced step on chemical reactions.",

This proximity effect can be mitigated by proximity effect correction provided that accurate and validated models of the point-spread function of the electron scattering are available. Most works so far considered a double-Gaussian model of the electron point-spread function, which is very inaccurate for modern electron-beam writers with high acceleration voltages. We present measurements of the process point-spread function for chemically semi-amplified resist on silicon and indium phosphide substrates using a 150 kV electron-beam lithography system. We find that the double-Gaussian model deviates from experiments by up to four orders of magnitude. We propose instead a model comprising the sum of a power-law and a Gaussian, which is in excellent agreement with simulations of the electron scattering obtained by a Monte Carlo method. We apply the power-law plus Gaussian model to quantify the electron scattering and proximity effect correction parameters across material stacks, processing, and voltages from 5 kV to 150 kV. We find that the power-law term remains remarkably constant, whereas the long-range dose contributions and the clearing dose are significantly affected by the substrate and the acceleration voltage.",

In addition to the charge property, the electron also has the spin property, which is exploited in the field of spintronics to access novel magnetically controlled device actions that are not accessible to conventional electronics. An interesting question is whether the two can be fruitfully integrated into a single device concept to expand the horizon of device design and applications. Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of virgin and lithiated conducting intermetallic anti-perovskite with nominal stoichiometry represented as LixFe3SnC (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) to establish the principle of reversible and concurrent charge and spin polarization storage that can be aptly christened as Iono-Spintronics, representing a notion of a spintronic battery. The experimental results, however, showed that lithiation turns the system into a biphasic state comprised of tin-lithium alloy (due to the high affinity of Sn for Li) along with lithiated Fe3C. The process exhibits multiple cyclability (rechargeability).",

      "abstract": "Conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging electroactive materials for (opto-)electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve reliable MOF-based devices via the existing synthesis methods that are compatible with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, as the surface roughness of thus-far synthetic MOF films or pellets is rather high for efficient electrode contact. Here, we develop an on-liquid-gallium surface synthesis (OLGSS) strategy under chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions for the controlled growth of two-dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c-MOF) thin films with ten-fold improvement of surface flatness (surface roughness can reach as low as ~2 {\\AA}) compared with MOF films grown by the traditional methods. Supported by theoretical modeling, we unveil a layer-by-layer CVD growth mode for constructing flattening surfaces, that is triggered by the high adhesion energy between gallium (Ga) and planar aromatic ligands. We further demonstrate the generality of the as-proposed OLGSS strategy by reproducing such a flat surface over nine different 2D c-MOF films with variable thicknesses (~2 to 208 nm) and large lateral sizes (over 1 cm2). The resultant ultra-smooth 2D c-MOF films enable the formation of high-quality electrical contacts with gold (Au) electrodes, leading to a reduction of contact resistance by over ten orders of magnitude compared to the traditional uneven MOF films. Furthermore, due to the efficient interfacial interaction benifited from the high-quality contacts, the prepared van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) of OLGSS c-MOF and MoS2 exhibits intriguing photoluminescence (PL) enhancement, PL peak shift and large work function modulation. The establishment of the reliable OLGSS method provides the chances to push the development of MOF electronics and the construction of multicomponent MOF-based heterostructure materials.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this \"zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube\" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.",

      "abstract": "Frictional contacts lead to the formation of a surface layer called the third body, consisting of wear particles and structures resulting from their agglomerates. Its behavior and properties at the nanoscale control the macroscopic tribological performance. It is known that wear particles and surface topography evolve with time and mutually influence one another. However, the formation of the mature third body is largely uncharted territory and the properties of its early stages are unknown. Here we show how a third body initially consisting of particles acting as roller bearings transitions into a shear-band-like state by forming adhesive bridges between the particles. Using large-scale atomistic simulations on a brittle model material, we find that this transition is controlled by the growth and increasing disorganization of the particles with increasing sliding distance. Sliding resistance and wear rate are at first controlled by the surface roughness, but upon agglomeration wear stagnates and friction becomes solely dependent on the real contact area in accordance with the plasticity theory of contact by Bowden and Tabor.",

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\\\"om-scale CMOS era.",

      "abstract": "Cantilevered beams are of immense importance as structural and sensorial members for a number of applications. Endowing tailorable elasticity can have wide ranging engineering ramification. Such tailorability could be possible using some type of spatial gradation in the beam's material or cross section. However, these often require extensive additive and subtractive material processing or specialized casts. In this letter, we demonstrate an alternative bio inspired mechanical pathway, which is based on exploiting the nonlinearity that would arise from a functionally graded distribution of biomimetic scales on the surface using an analytical approach. This functional gradation is geometrically sourced and could arise from either spatial or angular gradation of scales. We analyze such a functionally graded cantilever beam under uniform loading. In comparison with uniformly distributed scales, we find significant differences in bending stiffness for both spatial and angular gradations. Spatial and angular functional gradation share some universality but also sharp contrasts in their effect on the underlying beam. A combination of both types of gradation in the structure can be used to alternatively increase or decrease stiffness and therefore a pathway to tailor the elasticity of a cantilever beam relatively easily. These results give rise to an architected framework for designing and optimizing the topography of leveraged solids.",

This incomplete dataset results in significant artifacts and poor resolution in the reconstructed image. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approach dubbed Perception Fused Iterative Tomography Reconstruction Engine, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with perceptional knowledge as a smart regularizer into an iterative solving engine. We employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to optimize the solution in both physics and image domains, thereby achieving a physically coherent and visually enhanced result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using various experimental datasets obtained with different x-ray microscopy techniques. All show significantly improved reconstruction even with a missing wedge of over 100 degrees - a scenario where conventional methods fail. Notably, it also improves the reconstruction in case of sparse projections, despite the network not being specifically trained for that. This demonstrates the robustness and generality of our method of addressing commonly occurring challenges in 3D x-ray imaging applications for real-world problems.",

      "abstract": "Colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy allows to explore sliding states of vanishing friction, i.e. superlubricity, in mesoscopic graphite contacts. Superlubricity is known to appear upon formation of a triboinduced transfer layer, originated by material transfer of graphene flakes from the graphitic substrate to the colloidal probe. Previous studies suggest that friction vanishes due to crystalline incommensurability at the newly formed interface. However this picture still lacks several details, such as the roles of the tribolayer roughness and of loading conditions. Hereafter we gain deeper insight into the tribological response of micrometric silica beads sliding on graphite under ambient conditions. We show that the tribotransferred flakes behave as lubricious nanoasperities with a twofold role. First, they decrease the silica-graphite true contact area, in fact causing a breakdown of adhesion and friction by one order of magnitude. Second, they govern mechanical dissipation through the specific energy landscape experienced by the topographically-highest triboinduced nanoasperity. Remarkably, such contact junctions can undergo a load-driven atomic-scale transition from continuous superlubric sliding to dissipative stick-slip, that agrees with the single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Superlubricity in mesoscopic silica-graphite junctions may therefore arise from the load-controlled competition between interfacial crystalline incommensurability and contact pinning effects at one dominant nanoasperity.",

Here, we present a new and simple near-zero PR 2D topological model based on a structural block composed of two smooth and rigid bars connected by a soft membrane or spring. It is not based on re-entrant or honeycomb-like configurations, which have been the basis of many null or quasi-null PR models. Our topological model was 3D printed and the experimentally obtained PR was$-0.003\\,\\pm 0.001\\,$, which is one the closest to zero value ever reported. This topological model can be easily extended to 3D systems and with compression in any direction. The advantages and disadvantages of these models are also addressed.",

Thus, this work introduces Growable Online Locomotion Learning Under Multicondition (GOLLUM), which exploits the interpretability feature to address the aforementioned challenges. GOLLUM has two dimensions of interpretability: layer-wise interpretability for neural control function encoding and column-wise interpretability for robot skill encoding. With this interpretable control structure, GOLLUM utilizes neurogenesis to unsupervisely increment columns (ring-like networks); each column is trained separately to encode and maintain a specific primary robot skill. GOLLUM also transfers the parameters to new skills and supplements the learned combination of acquired skills through another neural mapping layer added (layer-wise) with online supplementary learning. On a physical hexapod robot, GOLLUM successfully acquired multiple locomotion skills (e.g., walking, slope climbing, and bouncing) autonomously and continuously within an hour using a simple reward function. Furthermore, it demonstrated the capability of combining previous learned skills to facilitate the learning process of new skills while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Compared to state-of-the-art locomotion learning approaches, GOLLUM is the only approach that addresses the four challenges above mentioned without human intervention. It also emphasizes the potential exploitation of interpretability to achieve autonomous lifelong learning machines.",

However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.",

      "abstract": "Superlubricity, a state where friction between two contact surfaces is nearly zero, has a great potential to revolutionize various mechanical systems by significantly reducing energy dissipation and enhancing efficiency. It can be realized either by structural incommensurate contact between crystalline surfaces or by creating highly passive interfaces to cancel out the adhesive forces. However, fabricating and maintaining such superlubric surfaces still present challenges, often disabled by surface structural defects or susceptibility to humid atmospheres, which renders superlubricity fragile. Here, we propose a novel strategy of photoelectron superlubricity (PESL), where robust superlubricity can be achieved in humid atmospheres by in-situ laser-irradiating the contact interface of an amorphous carbon film sliding against sapphire ball. We demonstrate that PESL not only exhibits a high resistance to environmental disturbances but also features rapid response. The formation of PESL originates from the laser-irradiating induced formation of nanographene-layered interface and enrichment of photoelectrons at the interface, resulting in a repulsive electric field between the nanographene layers. The discovery of PESL opens a new avenue for achieving superlubricity, and also provides novel insights for smart friction, mechanical motion control and light manipulation.",

After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.",

      "abstract": "The development of tissue engineering structures (scaffolds) for the reconstruction of bone tissue defects is the relevant task of modern biomedical materials science. Compared to metal-based structures, polymer constructs provide numerous advantages, among them - better processibility and metallosis avoidance. Owing to its high mechanical performance and biocompatibility, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) became a promising material for the development of such structures. Previously, a method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on PEKK surface was proposed by our group for the enhancement of stem cell adhesion. In the present study, we propose a single-step method of HAp immobilization on the surface of 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. The proposed approach allowed to preserve the morphology (pore diameter, width of the printed lines) of the pristine implants. With that, up to 35.0+-14.0 % of the sample surface were coated with HAp particles, which resulted in improved hydrophilicity (0 degrees water contact angle). The calcium and phosphorus content on the surface of the modified samples was up to 17.4+-4.1 and 8.0+-1.7 wt. %, respectively. Importantly, the proposed modification preserved compressive strength of the 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. HAp immobilization provided better adhesion of stem cells (from 121+-40 cells/mm2 to 234+-8 cells/mm2) and induce their osteogenic differentiation.",

      "abstract": "This study presents a simplified FEM modeling approach suitable for large structures made of corrugated boards, such as customized packages, based on a homogenization method, which is combined with correction factors for internal mechanisms. The homogenization process reduces computational time by transforming flute geometries into equivalent elastic models. In large deformations and in the presence of contact for a given geometry, the effective elastic modulus in the thickness direction, as well as the effective thickness of the structure, are corrected by two statistical Weibull distributions representing the contact and buckling mechanisms in a corrugated board. The Weibull parameters are obtained via experimental analysis, and such a process is then validated. The results demonstrate that the statistical parameters ($\\beta_1 = 0.14$, $\\beta_2 = 1.31$) can be used for the simplistic representation of corrugated boards, being computationally efficient. This research contributes to the optimization of corrugated packaging design, specifically by simplifying FEM models for faster yet equally accurate simulations.",

      "abstract": "The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, a systematic study of how microstructural variations influence nonlinear tissue mechanics is still lacking. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. By virtually replicating microstructural features of reconstituted collagen networks, such as fiber volume fractions and cross-link concentration, we evaluate the robustness of our simulations. Analyzing the nonlinear elastic behavior at varying polymerization temperatures, we find consistency between the in silico results and in vitro data from the literature. We extend our investigation beyond empirically measurable factors to explore microstructural effects at the single fiber level (i.e., fibril morphology and stiffness) that are challenging to investigate experimentally. TopoGEN allows us to mechanistically explore localized microstructural phenomena and relate microstructural changes to the bulk mechanical response of soft biological materials, hence providing an indispensable tool to advance the fields of tissue biomechanics and engineering.",

Here, we present a fluctuational electrodynamic study of thermal radiation between twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), motivated by its unusual and highly tunable plasmonic properties. We show that near-field heat flow can vary by more than 10-fold over only a few degrees of twist, and identify special angles leading to heat flow extrema. These special angles are dictated by the Drude weight in the intraband optical conductivity of TBLG, and are roughly linear with the chemical potential. Further, we observe multiband thermal transport due to the increasing role of interband transitions as the twist angle decreases, in analogy to monolayer graphene in a magnetic field. Our findings are understood via the surface plasmons in TBLG, and highlight its potential for manipulating radiative heat flow.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the role of cholesterol in ionic liquid (IL)-membrane interactions is essential for advancing biomedical applications of ILs, including the development of innovative antimicrobial agents. In this study, we explore the intricate and multifaceted role of cholesterol in modulating IL-membrane interactions, employing a comprehensive suite of biophysical techniques. We systematically examine how IL alkyl chain length and membrane physical state influence the impact of cholesterol on IL-lipid membrane interaction. The incorporation of ILs is shown to increase the area per lipid in both pristine dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-cholesterol membranes. Cholesterol modulates the impact of ILs on lipid conformation, membrane viscoelasticity, and phase behavior. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering measurements reveal that cholesterol mitigates IL-induced structural perturbations in vesicles. Our isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal that the presence of cholesterol significantly weakens the binding of ILs to membranes. Intriguingly, despite this reduced binding affinity, cholesterol-containing membranes demonstrate enhanced permeabilization. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to cholesterol's ordering of lipid membranes, which increases susceptibility to stress and defects. Our results underscore the complex and non-universal interplay between lipid composition, IL alkyl chain length, and membrane phase state. These insights provide a deeper understanding of cholesterol's role in IL-membrane interactions, paving the way for the design of advanced applications of ILs in antimicrobial therapy and drug delivery.",

      "abstract": "Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work, we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow, important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive computational results.",

In this study, we developed a cavity electromechanical system that integrates a 3C-SiC membrane and a rectangular superconducting cavity to observe the generation of nearly degenerate pairs of mechanical modes. Subsequently, we derive the expression for intrinsic frequency under nonuniform stress and find that this method supports a remarkably resolution for stress analysis in thin films. Experimentally, we perform collective fitting on the measured set of 57 mechanical modes, revealing deviations in biaxial non-uniform stress on the order of MPa. These degeneracy-broken mechanical modes exhibit exceptional quality factors as high as $10^8$ in a thermal bath of 10 mK. Furthermore, Allan deviation indicates that these modes exhibit extremely stable frequencies compared with different types of optomechanical devices. We then performed state-swapping between near-degenerate mode pairs, demonstrating the transfer efficiency exceeding 78\\%, attributed to their exceptionally long lifetimes. This study paves the way for the design of compact quantum phononic devices featuring high-quality-factor mechanical multimode.",

The most attractive properties of tungsten for magnetic and inertial fusion energy reactors are its high melting point, high thermal conductivity, low sputtering yield, and low long-term disposal radioactive footprint. However, tungsten also presents a very low fracture toughness, primarily associated with inter-granular failure and bulk plasticity, limiting its applications. In recent years, several families of tungsten-based alloys have been explored to overcome the aforementioned limitations of pure tungsten. These might include tungsten-based high-entropy alloys (W-HEAs) and the so-called tungsten-based \"smart alloys\". In this work, we present a computational approach that uses first-principles DFT electronic structure calculations to understand the effect of the chemical environment on tungsten-based alloys. In particular, we compared the Special Quasi-random Structure (SQS) and the DFT-coupled Monte Carlo (MC-DFT) methods when investigating the short-range order and elastic properties of two equimolar WCrTaTi and WVTaTi W-HEAs, and two WCrTi and WCrY W-SAs. We found that structures after MC-DFT calculation have lower cohesive energies than SQS structures, with shorter lattice constants, and large elastic properties values. Furthermore, distinct element segregation was studied by calculating the SRO parameter and radius distribution function. The total density of states suggested that the existence of SRO could improve the stability of the structure.",

      "abstract": "Human walking efficiency relies on the elastic recoil of the Achilles tendon, facilitated by a \"catapult mechanism\" that stores energy during stance and releases it during push-off. The catapult release mechanism could include the passive flexion of the knee, as the main part of knee flexion was reported to happen passively after leading leg touch-down. This study is the first to investigate the effects of passive versus active knee flexion initiation, using the bipedal EcoWalker-2 robot with passive ankles. By leveraging the precision of robotic measurements, we aimed to elucidate the importance of timing of gait events and its impact on momentum and kinetic energy changes of the robot. The EcoWalker-2 walked successfully with both initiation methods, maintaining toe clearance. Passive knee flexion initiation resulted in a 3% of the gait cycle later onset of ankle plantar flexion, leading to 87% larger increase in the trailing leg horizontal momentum, and 188% larger magnitude increase in the center of mass momentum vector during the step-to-step transition. Our findings highlight the role of knee flexion in the release of the catapult, and timing of gait events, providing insights into human-like walking mechanics and potential applications in rehabilitation, orthosis, and prosthesis development.",

Lightweight materials allow energy saving and reduce the amount of resources required for manufacturing. Researchers have expended significant efforts in the quest for such materials, which require new concepts in both tailoring material microstructure as well as structural design. Architectured materials, which take advantage of new engineering paradigms, have recently emerged as an exciting avenue to create bespoke combinations of desired macroscopic material responses. In some instances, rather unique structures have emerged from advanced geometrical concepts (e.g. gyroids, menger cubes, or origami/kirigami-based structures), while in others innovation has emerged from mimicking nature in bio-inspired materials (e.g. honeycomb structures, nacre, fish scales etc.). Beyond design, additive manufacturing has enabled the facile fabrication of complex geometrical and bio-inspired architectures, using computer aided design models. The combination of simulations and experiments on these structures has led to an enhancement of mechanical properties, including strength, stiffness and toughness. In this review, we provide a perspective on topologically engineered architectured materials that exhibit optimal mechanical behaviour and can be readily printed using additive manufacturing.",

      "abstract": "Optical components and circuits that deal with multiple signal generation and processing are quintessential for artificial neural networks. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept four-layered organic optical artificial neural network (ANN)-like architecture, constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN), employing an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip-based mechanical micromanipulation technique. Initially, the strategic selection of four MPyIN crystal active waveguides of varying lengths, mechanically bending them into serpentine-like forms, followed by their hierarchical integration, creates neuron-like, four-layered interconnected optical waveguides with six optical synapses. The synapses in the ANN-like architecture enable parallel transmissions of passive optical signals via evanescent coupling across multiple paths through various layers of the serpentine-shaped optical waveguides. Notably, the feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to multiply and split the optical signal generated at any input into four diverging signals with varying magnitudes. Here, certain outputs deliver a mixed signal (passive and active) due to diverging and converging optical transmission paths. This hierarchical, ANN-like tiny architecture paves the way for the development of smart optical neural networks utilizing multiple emissive and phase-changing organic crystals.",

      "abstract": "High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.",

      "abstract": "A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.",

Actively managing diffusion noise through, for example, sample confinement, is likely to unveil alternative noise sources which so far have been disregarded, as they occur in longer time-scales and are, consequently, masked by diffusion. These secondary noise sources could diminish the advantages provided by sample confinement but, on the other hand, they can provide with valuable information about the behavior of the sample and its interactions. In this article, we study for the first time and in detail two noise models for confined nano-NMR, namely, surface interactions and porosity, and discuss their implications for typical nano-NMR experiments.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for high energy storage materials has garnered substantial attention towards lead-free ferroelectric nanocrystals (NCs), such as BaTiO3 (BTO), for next-generation multilayer ceramic capacitors. Notably, it remains challenging to accurately measure the dielectric constant and polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for BTO NCs. Herein, we report on nonlinear ferroelectric characteristics of BTO NCs via a polymer nanocomposite approach. Specifically, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)(PVP)/BTO nanocomposite films of 3-10 {\\mu}m thickness, containing 380 nm tetragonal-phased and 60 nm cubic-phased BTO NCs with uniform particle dispersion, were prepared. Theoretical deconvolution of the broad experimental P-E loops of the PVP/BTO NC composite films revealed three contributions, that is, the linear deformational polarization of the nanocomposites, the polarization of BTO NCs (Pp ), and the polarization from strong particle-particle interactions. Using different mixing rules and nonlinear dielectric analysis, the overall dielectric constants of BTO NCs were obtained, from which the internal field in the BTO NCs (Ep ) was estimated. Consequently, the Pp-Ep hysteresis loops were obtained for the BTO380 and BTO60 NCs. Interestingly, BTO380 exhibited square-shaped ferroelectric loops, whereas BTO60 displayed slim paraelectric loops. This work presents a robust and versatile route to extract the Pp-Ep loops of ferroelectric NCs from polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.",

      "abstract": "The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.",

      "abstract": "Artificial skin with the sense of touch can support robots to interact with the surrounding environment efficiently and accomplish complex tasks. Traditional multi-layered artificial skins require complex manufacturing processes which can result in high cost as well as limitations on the material and size of the skin. In this paper, we demonstrate a machine learning based approach to predict positions of point loads using the most direct response as input signal: strain distribution. Starting with the simplest problem, predicting the position of a single point load acting on a flat surface, an ML model is developed, trained, and tested. Accurate predictions are obtained from the ML model, parameters that affect the accuracy are discussed, and validation tests are performed. After that, the ML model is modified to solve multi-objective prediction problems: predicting positions and magnitudes of multiple point loads. In the end, the ML model is upgraded to a 2-step model to predict the position of a point load acting on a deformable surface. The demonstrated approach enables a normal untreated surface to feel a touch no matter what the surface is made of or how large or small the size of the surface is. Therefore, we believe this ML-based load position prediction approach could be a promising tool for applications such as flexible touch screens, smart skin for robots, and micro touch sensors.",

A notable feature of ViTacTip is its transparent skin, which incorporates a `see-through-skin' mechanism. This mechanism aims at capturing detailed object features upon contact, significantly improving both vision-based and proximity perception capabilities. In parallel, the biomimetic tips embedded in the sensor's skin are designed to amplify contact details, thus substantially augmenting tactile and derived force perception abilities. To demonstrate the multi-modal capabilities of ViTacTip, we developed a multi-task learning model that enables simultaneous recognition of hardness, material, and textures. To assess the functionality and validate the versatility of ViTacTip, we conducted extensive benchmarking experiments, including object recognition, contact point detection, pose regression, and grating identification. To facilitate seamless switching between various sensing modalities, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach. This method enhances the applicability of the ViTacTip sensor across diverse environments by enabling cross-modality interpretation.",

      "abstract": "We report the emergence of a novel interface-induced shape anisotropy component in zigzag-structured thin films fabricated via Sequential Oblique Angle Deposition (S-OAD). In this study, we systematically investigate cobalt (Co) and Co2FeAl (CFA) thin films by varying column length, number of bilayers, and magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) to explore how structural modulation affects magnetic behavior. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements in conjunction with synchrotron-based grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and 2D X-ray diffraction (2DXRD), we reveal that the interplay between interface-induced, shape, and crystalline anisotropies allows for a tunable magnetic response, ranging from isotropic to anisotropic behavior. The observed uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) exceeds that of conventional OAD films, while column merging is effectively suppressed through precise multilayer engineering. Structural analysis confirms that periodic, high-density interfaces at the junctions of oppositely tilted columns are central to this anisotropy control. These findings demonstrate that interface engineering and columnar nanostructuring within zigzag nanostructures offer a powerful route for tailoring magnetic properties in zigzag thin films, enabling their application in next-generation spintronic and magnetic sensor technologies.",

A key challenge in the development of 3D nanomagnets is the ability to locally control the magnetic configuration, which is essential to achieve desired functionalities. In this work, the magnetization reversal mechanism of a three-dimensional nanoarchitecture fabricated using focused electron beam-induced deposition is investigated by combining direct observation via scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with finite element micromagnetic simulations. In particular, our investigation shows that the magnetization of the components of a three-dimensional Co3 Fe tetrapod can be reversed individually and sequentially. Finally, it is demonstrated that complete control and reconfigurability of the system can be achieved by tuning the direction of the applied magnetic field.",

In this study, nanograin generation is used to enhance the strength and phase transformation is employed to reduce the elastic modulus of a biocompatible Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-based HEA. The alloy is treated via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) process, leading to (i) a BCC (body-centered cubic) to omega phase transformation with [101]{\\omega}//[011]BCC and [211]omega//[121]BCC through a twining mechanism, (ii) nanograin formation with a mean grain size of 20 nm, and (iii) dislocation generation particularly close to BCC-omega interphase boundaries. These structural and microstructural features enhance hardness, increase tensile strength up to 2130 MPa, achieve tensile elongation exceeding 13%, reduce elastic modulus down to 69 GPa and improve biocompatibility. Additionally, the HEA exhibits improved anodization, resulting in a homogenous distribution of oxide nanotubes on the surface with a smaller tube diameter and a higher tube length compared to pure titanium. These remarkable properties, which are engineered by the generation of defective nanograins and the co-existence of BCC and metastable omega phases, highlight the potential of HEAs treated using severe plastic deformation for future biomedical usage, particularly in the orthopedic sector.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.",

      "abstract": "Legged machines are becoming increasingly agile and adaptive but they have so far lacked the basic reconfigurability of legged animals, which have been rearranged and reshaped to fill millions of niches. Unlike their biological counterparts, legged machines have largely converged over the past decade to canonical quadrupedal and bipedal architectures that cannot be easily reconfigured to meet new tasks or recover from injury. Here we introduce autonomous modular legs: agile yet minimal, single-degree-of-freedom jointed links that can learn complex dynamic behaviors and may be freely attached to form legged metamachines at the meter scale. This enables rapid repair, redesign, and recombination of highly-dynamic modular agents that move quickly and acrobatically (non-quasistatically) through unstructured environments. Because each module is itself a complete agent, legged metamachines are able to sustain deep structural damage that would completely disable other legged robots. We also show how to encode the vast space of possible body configurations into a compact latent design genome that can be efficiently explored, revealing a wide diversity of novel legged forms.",

      "abstract": "Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.",

      "abstract": "Magneto-plasmonic nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for advanced sensing applications. However, conventional fabrication methods, such as lithography and sputtering, often involve high costs and complex processes. This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating nickel nano-rings (200-600 nm in diameter) utilizing nanosphere lithography and selective electroless deposition on ITO substrates. The resulting nickel-silver-boron (Ni-Ag-B) nanoarrays exhibit uniform, durable coatings with robust covalent bonds, providing a simpler, more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The unique ring-shaped geometry of the nano-rings enhances plasmonic effects by concentrating the electromagnetic field, thus outperforming other nanostructures. Unlike thin films, these nano-rings demonstrate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) within the 470-614 nm range when illuminated at a 45$^{\\deg}$ incident angle. Moreover, ellipsometry parameter calculations and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements revealed narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) peaks at 512 nm and 560 nm, indicating superior sensitivity for detection compared to conventional SPR and ellipsometry-SPR techniques. Finite element simulations using COMSOL provided valuable insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the electromagnetic response of the nano-rings, confirming their potential for optical communication and highly sensitive sensing technologies. This study addresses limitations in existing magneto-plasmonic systems, offering a scalable and innovative solution for the development of next-generation sensing applications.",

However, high-resolution tools for studying their dynamic responses to environmental changes and collective cellular behavior remain scarce. To characterize and quantify biofilm development, we present a droplet-based microfluidic platform combined with an image analysis tool for in-situ studies. In this setup, Bacillus subtilis was inoculated in liquid Lysogeny Broth microdroplets, and biofilm formation was examined within emulsions at the water-oil interface. Bacteria were encapsulated in droplets, which were then trapped in compartments, allowing continuous optical access throughout biofilm formation. Droplets, each forming a distinct microenvironment, were generated at high throughput using flow-controlled pressure pumps, ensuring monodispersity. A microfluidic multi-injection valve enabled rapid switching of encapsulation conditions without disrupting droplet generation, allowing side-by-side comparison. Our platform supports fluorescence microscopy imaging and quantitative analysis of droplet content, along with time-lapse bright-field microscopy for dynamic observations. To process high-throughput, complex data, we integrated an automated, unsupervised image analysis tool based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This AI-driven approach efficiently captured biofilm structures in a latent space, enabling detailed pattern recognition and analysis. Our results demonstrate the accurate detection and quantification of biofilms using thresholding and masking applied to latent space representations, enabling the precise measurement of biofilm and aggregate areas.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density ($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the dataset to be re-measured. These findings highlight the importance of data quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive reliability in materials science.",

However, the dependence of this forces on the distance of separation between plates is very complex. Two widely different non-retarded and retarded regimes are well known, but these have been traditionally studied separately. Much less is known about the important experimentally accesible cross-over regime. In this study, we provide analytical approximations for the van der Waals forces between two plates that interpolates exactly between the short distance and long distance behavior, and provides new insight into the crossover from London to Casimir forces at finite temperature. At short distance, where the behavior is dominated by non-retarded interactions, we work out a very accurate simplified approximation for the Hamaker constant which adopts analytical form for both the Drude and Lorentz models of dielectric response. We apply our analytical expressions for the study of forces between metallic plates, and observe very good agreement with exact results from numerical calculations. Our results show that contributions of interband transitions remain important in the experimentally accessible regime of decades nm for several metals, including gold.",

      "abstract": "In pellet manufacturing various ingredients in powder or particle form are pressed together into a dense product, a pellet, with better nutritional, calorific, and handling properties than the individual input ingredients themselves. For this reason, pellet manufacturing is applied to up-convert industrial co-products from various sectors like agriculture, forestry, human food, or bio-energy production, to valorize their waste-streams into more valuable products. However, processing such diverse ingredient streams presents an industrial challenge and raises the important scientific question: \"Under which process conditions do loose pellet ingredients bind together to form a mechanically rigid and durable pellet?\" In this work we provide new answers to this old research question by determining the causal relationships between processing parameters and physical pellet quality. Systematic pelleting experiments reveal that the interplay of typical process parameters such as steam conditioning temperature, production rate, and die geometry, can be understood in an overarching framework of process interactions. We introduce the concept of the \"stickiness temperature,\" $\\mathrm{T^*}$, marking the onset of critical enthalpic reactions necessary for pellet agglomeration, the boundary condition for bond formation within a pellet. Our framework demonstrates how $T^*$ is achieved through a combination of steam conditioning and friction, and how these conditions can be controlled by adjusting process parameters. Our findings underscore the significance of pellet temperature in conjunction with die residence time, for optimizing physical pellet quality while reducing energy consumption per kilogram of product. Validating our results in a trial and leveraging existing literature data, our framework provides handles to intelligently enhance the efficiency and sustainability of pelleting processes.",

This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.",

      "abstract": "The propulsion of many eukaryotic cells is generated by flagella, flexible slender filaments that are actively oscillating in space and time. The dynamics of these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of artificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion depends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in turn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In this work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical (bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using mathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a slender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the optimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the time-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing a specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based variational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of bending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff near the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that depends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These findings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.",

Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes.

Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate.

      "title": "Rotograb: Combining Biomimetic Hands with Industrial Grippers using a   Rotating Thumb",
      "abstract": "The development of robotic grippers and hands for automation aims to emulate human dexterity without sacrificing the efficiency of industrial grippers. This study introduces Rotograb, a tendon-actuated robotic hand featuring a novel rotating thumb. The aim is to combine the dexterity of human hands with the efficiency of industrial grippers. The rotating thumb enlarges the workspace and allows in-hand manipulation. A novel joint design minimizes movement interference and simplifies kinematics, using a cutout for tendon routing. We integrate teleoperation, using a depth camera for real-time tracking and autonomous manipulation powered by reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Rotograb's rotating thumb greatly improves both operational versatility and workspace. It can handle various grasping and manipulation tasks with objects from the YCB dataset, with particularly good results when rotating objects within its grasp. Rotograb represents a notable step towards bridging the capability gap between human hands and industrial grippers. The tendon-routing and thumb-rotating mechanisms allow for a new level of control and dexterity. Integrating teleoperation and autonomous learning underscores Rotograb's adaptability and sophistication, promising substantial advancements in both robotics research and practical applications.",

      "abstract": "Diffusiophoresis of charged particles in the presence of electrolytes has been extensively studied in the literature. However, in these setups, particles typically move in a single direction, either up or down the electrolyte gradient. Here, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which a particle can reverse its diffusiophoretic direction within the same setup, leading to the formation of a focusing band under steady-state concentration gradients. Using multi-ion diffusiophoresis calculations, we simulate particle transport in an acid-based reaction system where salt is added alongside the acid. For a range of salt concentrations, particles focus within the channel. Our analysis reveals that a pH-dependent zeta potential is necessary for this focusing to occur, and determines where the particles focus, i.e., on or off the acid-base reaction front. We report qualitative agreement with prior experimental observations and derive analytical conditions governing particle focusing, highlighting the delicate balance between concentration gradients and zeta potential variations. The work elucidates the crucial physics of pH-dependent zeta potential and opens new avenues for exploring diffusiophoresis in acid-base systems, with implications for microfluidic design and biophysical transport processes.",

Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.",

      "abstract": "Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features.   In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.",

A key attribute of the resulting designs is connectivity, which involves controlling the presence of solid and/or void islands of material. This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of existing connectivity constraints developed for continuous design representations and highlights their advantages and limitations in influencing design outcomes and performance. The review further includes a practical comparison of five different connectivity constraints using a topology optimization framework for sandwich panels that balances acoustic and structural performance. With Pareto-front analyses, the constraints are evaluated based on computational cost, monotonicity, parameter dependency, and their impact on the optimized designs, their performance, and underlying dynamics. From the comparison, practical insights and rule of thumbs have been derived. The findings emphasize the critical role of selecting appropriate connectivity constraints, given their significant effect on the optimization results.",

      "abstract": "The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo (CR-MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct MD simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at a low salt concentration, whereas at a high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, resulting in similar interaction profiles. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing NP interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in the presence of low salt concentrations.",

Here, we demonstrate dynamic and reversible control of local strain distributions in suspended trilayer tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS}_2$) via nanoindentation using a micro-mechanical spring patterned with nanoscale probes. Micro-photoluminescence measurements reveal that indentation using a ring-shaped probe induces a nearly uniform biaxial strain distribution accompanied by a reversible redshift of the neutral exciton peak, consistent with simulated strain magnitudes. We further show that the in-plane strain distribution is spatially programmable by engineering the probe geometry and present designs for inducing point-like, uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial strain distributions. The presented platform enables substrate-free, repeatable local strain engineering in suspended 2D materials and provides a versatile tool for streamlining the investigation of strain-dependent phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in mechanical metamaterials and piezoelectric energy harvesting provide exciting opportunities to guide and convert the mechanical energy in electromechanical systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control. However, practical realizations remain rare due to the lack of advanced modeling methods and interdisciplinary barriers. By integrating mechanical metamaterials with power electronics-based interface circuits, this paper makes a breakthrough with an electromechanical friction-induced metamaterial node, which realizes self-powered sensing and broadband vibration attenuation in the same time. A reduced-order modeling-based numerical harmonic balance method has been established for general nonlinear metamaterials with local nonlinearities, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The electromechanical friction induced by synchronized switching interface circuits has been revealed for the first time, leading to energy harvesting abilities and the broader nonlinear bandgap and higher harmonics induced vibration attenuation. Experimentally, an electromechanical metamaterial node is realized for self-powered sensing of temperature and acceleration data, highlighting its potential for structural health monitoring and Internet of Things applications. This study provides a practical path to digitalizing structures and systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control by combining advanced interface circuits with mechanical metamaterials.",

      "abstract": "Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films with emission in both the UV and visible regions. The inclusion of hafnium (Hf) ions in the nodes of the MOF increases the interaction cross-section with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and dramatically increasing the system scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of bimolecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes between excited states that partially quench the MOF luminescence, resulting in ultrafast scintillation pulses under X-ray excitation with kinetics in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved by incorporating Hf ions is large enough to maintain the light yield of the films above 104 ph/MeV under soft X-rays. These unprecedented high efficiencies and simultaneous ultrafast emission kinetics obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, together with the versatility of its composition allowing for further application-specific modifications, place the MOF platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of ultrafast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.",

Latter synthetic provides higher throughput over physiological EVs. However they face size-stability and self-agglomeration challenges in physiological solutions to be properly characterized and addressed. Here we demonstrate a fast and high-throughput nanovesicle screening methodology relying on dynamic light scattering (DLS) complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, suitable for the evaluation of hydrodynamic size instabilities and aggregation effects in nanovesicle solutions under varying experimental conditions and apply it to the analysis of bio-engineered nanovesicles derived from erythrocytes as well as physiological extracellular vesicles isolated from animal seminal plasma. The synthetic vesicles exhibit a significantly higher degree of agglomeration, with only 8 % of them falling within the typical extracellular vesicle size range (30-200 nm) in their original preparation conditions. Concurrent zeta potential measurements performed on both physiological and synthetic nanovesicles yielded values in the range of -17 to -22 mV, with no apparent correlation to their agglomeration tendencies. However, mild sonication and dilution were found to be effective means to restore the portion of EVs-like nanovesicles in synthetic preparations to values of 54% and 63%, respectively, The results illustrate the capability of this DLS-AFM-based analytical method for real-time, high-throughput and quantitative assessments of agglomeration effects and size instabilities in bioengineered nanovesicle solutions, providing a powerful and easy-to-use tool to gain insights to overcome such deleterious effects and leverage the full potential of this promising biocompatible drug-delivery carriers for a broad range of pharmaceutical applications.",

      "abstract": "Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), as the most prominent lubrication additive, forms tribofilms consisting primarily of zinc phosphate glasses containing sulfides. As sulfur is linked to environmental concerns, sulfur-free zinc phosphate coatings have been sputtered from a Zn3(PO4)2 target and investigated here. Based on the bridging to non-bridging oxygen ratio, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as deposited coatings are classified as metaphosphates. As the annealing temperature is increased, the chain lengths are reduced, as witnessed by XPS data indicated by a loss of phosphorus and oxygen of the coating surface, likely due to hydrolysis with water from the atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line scans show that the XPS-revealed composition change of the coating surface upon annealing occurs over the whole thickness of the coating. This alteration in composition and chain length reductions causes a rise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance. Therefore, the properties of the artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via a thermally stimulated composition change, causing an alternation in chain length from meta- to orthophosphate and thereby enabling the design of coatings with desired mechanical properties.",

However, the conventional approach of placing the piezos outside the substrate faces challenges and limited accessibility to industrial applications. We determine damping performance for long and slender sandwich beam structures utilizing active vibration control by internally placed piezoelectric shear sensors and actuators. Experimental and numerical results are presented for a clamped-free sandwich beam structure constructed with two stainless steel facings composed of a core layer of foam and a piezoelectric shear-actuator and sensor. This approach of internal actuator and sensor tends to tackle the problems within (high-tech) systems, i.e. mechanical vibrations, a limited amount of design volume, and vulnerability of externally placed piezoelectric transducers to outside conditions. By this new internal sensor-actuator approach, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature. The location of the sensor and actuator has been defined by numerical investigation of the \\textit{modal shear strain} and the \\textit{effective electro-mechanical coupling coefficient}. The frequency response of the sandwich beam structure has been evaluated using both numerical and experimental investigation. Positive Position Feedback has been employed on the numerical response to simulate the damping performance for the fundamental mode. Different controller gains have been used to analyze the trade-off between effective resonance suppression and increased low-frequency gain. The tip vibrations at the fundamental mode have been reduced from 5.01 mm to 0.34 mm amplitude at steady state, which represents a significant reduction.",

Here, we predict an avenue to identify the contribution of the quantum dots interface created static electric field on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to four-wave mixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is high. We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs originating from the three incoming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a contribution (NLOstatic) arising from the three oscillating laser fields and the static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques where FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction, and the response is distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows alteration in the interface can introduce phase variation in the NLOstatic signal, resulting in a distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our studies establish a range of ionic strength, which can be important to untwine the usual NLO signal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the interface of quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the different kinds of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also will pave the path towards different ion interactions through phase change in 2D spectra, and enormous scope will be employing deep learning-assisted phase recognition.",

      "abstract": "The $N$-step random walk, stretched in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\\sim \\exp\\left(-{\\rm const}\\, N^{1/3}\\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\\frac{L}{a}\\gg 1, \\frac{R}{a}\\gg 1$ conditioned that $\\frac{L}{R}=c={\\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c > \\pi$. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched (\"inflated\") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.",

With an increase of the immersion time in soft drinks, we found a significant increase of surface roughness (Ra) and a considerable decrease of elastic modulus (E) of the enamel. The prismatic structure of enamel was clearly observed after a one-hour immersion in Coca-Cola, which shows its strong erosion effect. A high surface roughness of enamel results in a high chance of cavities due to easier bacterial adhesion on rougher surface, while a drastic deterioration of the mechanical properties of the enamel weakens its protection property. Our findings show the variation of enamel surface at the very beginning stage of etching process by acidic drinks, which can also be applicable to the etching mechanism of enamel surface by other sources.",

Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \\emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment.

However, achieving wide-range, seamless, reversible, in-situ and robust tunability remains challenging and often impractical due to limitations in bandgap mechanisms and design principles. Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by 3-7 times (e.g. shifting from 250-430 Hz to 1400-2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in-situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can lead to significant vascular remodeling, resulting in altered pulmonary blood flow. Estimating the patient-specific contributions of each remodeling event is necessary to optimize and individualize clinical intervention strategies. In-silico modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to simulate pulmonary hemodynamics, and one of the primary requirements for robust in-silico modeling is an accurate representation of the pulmonary vasculature structure. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can be used to segment and reconstruct the proximal vasculature. However, contrast-enhanced imaging, such as CT pulmonary angiography, is required to obtain a comprehensive and high-fidelity view of the pulmonary vasculature. The clinical use of CT pulmonary angiography is limited by the complications associated with the injection of contrast agents. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged to effectively segment and reconstruct the pulmonary vasculature without the need for contrast-enhanced imaging. We have developed a method to create in-silico pulmonary angiogram phantoms with varying simulated contrast levels. The results indicated that adding simulated contrast can allow for successful segmentation of the pulmonary vasculature. We expect this method to assist with developing and training ML-based segmentation frameworks and aid in their validation, thereby improving the capability to segment and reconstruct pulmonary vasculature without using contrast-enhanced imaging.",

      "abstract": "Low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) enhances oil recovery at low cost in carbonate reservoirs, but its effectiveness requires precise control of injected water chemistry and interaction with reservoir minerals. This study develops an integrated reactive transport model coupling geochemical surface complexation modeling (SCM) with multiphase compositional dynamics to quantify wettability alteration during LSWF. The framework combines PHREEQC-based equilibrium calculations of the Total Bond Product (TBP), a wettability indicator derived from oil-calcite ionic bridging, with Corey-type relative permeability interpolation, resolved via COMSOL Multiphysics. Core flooding simulations, compared with experimental data from calcite systems at 100 degrees Celsius and 220 bar, reveal that magnesium and sulfate concentrations modulate TBP, reducing oil-rock adhesion under controlled low-salinity conditions. Parametric analysis demonstrates that acidic crude oils (TAN higher than 1 mg KOH per gram) exhibit TBP values approximately 2.5 times higher than sweet crudes, due to carboxylate-calcite bridging, while pH elevation (above 7.5) amplifies wettability shifts by promoting deprotonated carboxyl interactions. The model further identifies synergistic effects between magnesium (50 to 200 millimoles per kilogram of water) and sulfate (above 500 millimoles per kilogram of water), which reduce calcium-mediated oil adhesion through competitive mineral surface binding. By correlating TBP with fractional flow dynamics, this framework could support the optimization of injection strategies in carbonate reservoirs, suggesting that ion-specific adjustments are more effective than bulk salinity reduction.",

      "abstract": "Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.",

Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of \\textit{enhancement of index of refraction} (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. In contrast to classical approach used in \\cite{Panahpour2019}, we formulate both first- and second-order quantization to analyze nonlinear enhancement in the refractive index by modulating the response function of probe field. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of nonlinear refractive index which is essential for quantum technological applications. It also provides coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.",

      "abstract": "To improve transistor density and electronic performance, next-generation semiconductor devices are adopting three-dimensional architectures and feature sizes down to the few-nm regime, which require atomic-scale metrology to identify and resolve performance-limiting fabrication challenges. X-ray methods deliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial resolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron microscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We demonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational electron microscopy technique with sub-\\r{A}ngstr\\\"om lateral and nanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in devices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover and quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide wrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel gradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a bulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not previously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier mobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different atomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing conditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain relaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide direct experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for modeling and early fabrication optimization.",

Since the original proposal of Nadrian Seeman, significant advances have been achieved in the past four decades. During this glory time, the DNA origami technique developed by Paul Rothemund further pushed the field forward with a vigorous momentum, fostering a plethora of concepts, models, methodologies, and applications that were not thought of before. This review focuses on the recent progress in DNA origami-engineered nanomaterials in the past five years, outlining the exciting achievements as well as the unexplored research avenues.

      "abstract": "Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.",

      "abstract": "We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of \"surprising\" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.",

      "abstract": "The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD) has opened up new possibilities for the development of diamond-based electronic devices. However, the origin of the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) observed in surface-conducting HD remains unclear, an understanding that is crucial for advancing HD-based optoelectronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism of PPC in surface-conducting HD films. A systematic analysis was performed by tuning the carrier density via partial oxygen termination using an ozonation process. With increasing O-termination, both the decay time and the recombination barrier of photoexcited electron-hole pairs were found to decrease significantly, from 232 to 5 seconds, and from ~ 150 to 54 meV, respectively. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that PPC in HD is influenced by random local potential fluctuations, which delay the recombination of photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, the observed PPC behavior is closely associated with percolative transport processes within the HD film. Importantly, the dependence of PPC on sheet carrier density is correlated with Coulomb interactions between the two-dimensional hole gas and the surface adsorbate layer. This study offers new insights into the PPC mechanism in surface-conducting HD films, contributing to the broader understanding necessary for the design of advanced diamond-based optoelectronic devices.",

Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, both WT and CRISPR-modified cells exhibited distinct mechanical responses. Statistical analysis revealed that WT cells had different stiffness and viscosity compared to CRISPR-modified cells, as indicated by their Brillouin shift and FWHM values. The data suggest that Brillouin spectroscopy offers a viable method to differentiate between normal and mutated cells at the subcellular level, providing new insights into cellular mechanical properties relevant to cancer research.

      "abstract": "Atomic-scale ferroelectric thin films hold great promise for high-density, low-power applications but face stability and voltage scaling challenges at extreme thinness. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in single-crystalline two-dimensional (2D) Ga$_2$O$_3$, an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor, at just 6 angstrom thickness, exhibiting exceptional retention and thermal stability. We show that epitaxial beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can be exfoliated down to a half-unit cell thickness via a self-limiting mechanism, enabling a biaxial strain-induced phase transition into a novel ferroelectric layered structure. Strain modulation enables the reduction of polarization switching voltage to 0.8 V, meeting CMOS voltage scaling requirements. Theoretical calculations reveal that switching is driven by covalent bond reconstruction, effectively countering depolarization and enhancing stability. Additionally, we integrate ferroelectric 2D Ga$_2$O$_3$ onto silicon using a low-temperature, back-end-of-line-compatible process. This work advances the exploration of sub-nanometer ferroelectrics, paving the way for high-density, low-power, non-volatile applications seamlessly integrated with advanced silicon technology.",

      "abstract": "Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \\textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.",

Using heterogeneous YIG/Fe and YIG/Pt/Fe structures, fabricated by oblique deposition in a magnetic field, spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) measurements were performed. It was observed that the uniaxial anisotropy enables the emergence of spin-to-charge (AISHE) and orbital-to-charge (AIOHE) conversion signals in out-of-plane configurations, where the spin polarization is parallel to the direction of the spin current. Experimental analysis revealed that orbital dynamics, mediated by orbital Hall conductivity, are more prominent in Fe films due to the low spin-orbit interaction (SOC) and high orbital response. These findings provide fundamental insights for the advancement of orbitronics devices, indicating the potential for controlling orbital and spin currents through magnetic and anisotropic parameters.",

      "abstract": "Thin-shell structures, found in biological systems such as beetle carapaces and widely used in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering, achieve remarkable strength-to-mass ratio given their slenderness and curved geometries. However, their load-bearing capacity is highly sensitive to geometric imperfections, which are often unavoidable during fabrication and can trigger subcritical buckling. Silicone-based hemispherical domes have served as an experimental modal system to study this phenomenon, yet prior work has largely focused on localized dimples or flat imperfections, failing to capture the spatially distributed nature of real-world imperfection patterns. Here, we introduce an acoustic-assisted method for fabricating thin shells with spatially distributed, vibrational mode-shaped imperfections. Silicone is cast onto a thick elastic mold excited by a speaker, and vibration-induced flow during curing creates thickness variations. High-speed imaging and microCT scanning reveal accumulation of material at the antinodes of the mold's vibrational modes. We show that imperfection geometry can be tuned by acoustic frequency, while their amplitude increases with acoustic volume. Buckling experiments demonstrate significant reductions in critical pressure, offering a scalable platform to study and tune imperfection-sensitive mechanics. Beyond shell mechanics, we offer a scalable and tunable fabrication method for patterning soft materials in applications ranging from morphable surfaces to bioinspired design.",

Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems.

      "abstract": "Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how materials wear off following frictional sliding is a long-standing question in tribology. In this respect, the particular case of the wear of soft rubbery elastomeric materials stands apart: tire wear produces several million tonnes of abraded materials per year, bearing immense industrial and environmental impact, while the soft nature of elastomers and their inability to accommodate plastic deformation before failure renders their wear mechanisms almost intractable. Here, we harness mechanochemical approaches on model elastomeric materials, to reveal that mild elastomeric wear does not proceed from crack propagation processes, but rather from the continuous accumulation of diffuse damage by chain scission, extending well below the surface of the material. Damage accumulates in a discontinuous manner through micro-slippage events at the rough contacting asperities, with in-depth damage extension set by the characteristic asperity size. Surprisingly, damage grows through a slow logarithmic-like process over successive cycles, which we interpret as the occurrence of stress-activated scission events in a broad strand elastic energy landscape. These observations point to the probabilistic nature of this fatigue-like damage accumulation mechanism and allow us to formulate the wear rate as an integral of the damage cumulated over successive asperity sliding. Finally, by tuning the molecular architecture of our materials, we evidence an antagonistic relation between fracture resistance and wear resilience, set by the sensitivity of the material to stress fluctuations. Revealing the role of previously invisible subsurface damage in elastomeric wear, our approach should stimulate further physical-based approaches allowing for the development of sustainable and wear-resilient materials.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\\circ {\\rm C}$ and $-40^\\circ {\\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "In densely-packed two-dimensional systems of growing cells, such as rod-shaped bacteria, a number of experimental and numerical studies report distinct patterns of nematic orientational order in the presence of confinement. So far, these effects have been explained using variations of growing active nematic continuum theories, which incorporate feedback between growth-induced active stresses, the resulting material flow and nematic orientation, and were adapted to the specific geometry under investigation. Here, we first show that a direct, analytical prediction of orientation patterns based on a simple isotropic-growth assumption and the shear rate tensor of the expansion flow already covers previously observed cases. We use this method to tune orientation patterns and net topological defect charge in a systematic way using domain geometry, confirmed by agent-based simulations. We then show how this framework can be extended to quantitatively capture alignment strength, and explore its potential for cross-prediction across different geometries. Our simplified and unifying theoretical framework highlights the role of domain geometry in shaping nematic order of growing systems, and thereby provides a way to forward-engineer desired orientation patterns.",

      "abstract": "We show that the resistance distance between a pair of adjacent vertices in a phantom network generated randomly by a Monte-Carlo method depends on the existence of short cycles around it. Here we assume that phantom networks have no fixed points but their centers of mass are located at a point. The resistance distance corresponds to the mean-square deviation of the end-to-end vector along the strand connecting the adjacent vertices. We generate random networks with fixed valency $f$ but different densities of short cycles via a Metropolis method that rewires edges among four vertices chosen randomly. In the process the cycle rank is conserved. However, the densities of short cycles are determined by the rate of randomization $kT$ which appears in the acceptance ratio $\\exp(-\\Delta U/kT)$ of rewiring. If a strand has few short cycles around itself, the mean squared deviation of the strand is equal to $2/f$. If it is part of a short cycle, i.e., the network has a short loop which consists of a sequence of strands including the given strand itself, its resistance distance is smaller than $2/f$, while if it is not included in a cycle but adjacent to cycles, its resistance distance is larger than $2/f$. We show it via an electrical circuit analogy of the network. Moreover, we numerically show that the effect of multiple cycles on the resistance distance is expressed as a linear combination of the effects of isolated single cycles. It follows that cycles independently have an effect on the fluctuation properties of a strand in a polymer network.",

This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.",

It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.",

      "abstract": "Motion models are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from the data. This analysis immediately raises the following question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus the raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we explicitly make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission model (or measurement model). The emission model describes how photons emitted by fluorescently labeled particles are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the data likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, then it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the trajectory post-processed from the data. On the other hand, if the majority of the likelihood is numerically dominated by the emission model, then the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. We find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain approximately 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.",

Further MD simulations and contact mechanics analysis reveal that surface roughness can significantly reduce the adhesion energy and effective contact area between CuPc nanoribbons, and thus result in an ultralow GCA. In addition, the adhesion energy at the interface also depends on the stacking configuration of two CuPc nanoribbons, which may also contribute to the observed ultralow GCA.",

In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that Pd GB exhibits dramatically accelerated hydriding and dehydriding kinetics compared to ligand-free and ligand-capped Pd nanoparticles with similar crystallite sizes. Strain mapping using environmental transmission electron microscopy shows that strain is highly localized at GBs and intensifies upon hydrogen exposure, indicating preferential hydrogen insertion along GB sites. Density functional theory calculations support these findings, showing that hydrogen insertion near $\\Sigma$3(111) GBs is energetically more favorable and that tensile strain lowers insertion barriers. These results provide atomic-level insights into the role of GBs in hydride formation and suggest new design strategies for GB-engineered Pd-based functional materials.

      "abstract": "This Roadmap article addresses the critical and multifaceted challenge of plasma-facing component (PFC) damage caused by runaway electrons (REs) in tokamaks, a phenomenon that poses a significant threat to the viability and longevity of future fusion reactors such as ITER and DEMO. The dramatically increased RE production expected in future high-current tokamaks makes it difficult to avoid or mitigate REs when a plasma discharge terminates abnormally. Preventing damage from the intense localised heat loads REs can cause requires a holistic approach that considers plasma, REs and PFC damage. Despite decades of progress in understanding the physics of REs and the thermomechanical response of PFCs, their complex interplay remains poorly understood. This document aims to initiate a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to bridge this gap by reviewing experimental evidence, advancing diagnostic capabilities, and improving modelling tools across different scales, dimensionalities and fidelities. Key topics include RE beam formation and transport, damage mechanisms in brittle and metallic PFCs, and observations in major facilities such as JET, DIII-D, WEST and EAST. The Roadmap emphasises the urgency of predictive, high-fidelity modelling validated against well-diagnosed controlled experiments, particularly in the light of recent changes in ITER's wall material strategy and the growing importance of private sector initiatives. Each section of the article is written to provide a concise overview of one area of this multidisciplinary subject, with an assessment of the status, a look at current and future challenges, and a brief summary. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to guide future mitigation strategies and design resilient components that can withstand the loads imposed by REs, thus ensuring the safe and sustainable operation of the next generation of fusion power plants.",

      "title": "Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials   for low-temperature power generation",
      "abstract": "Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.",

      "abstract": "This research proposes a novel morphing structure with shells inspired by the movement of pillbugs. Instead of the pillbug body, a loopcoupled mechanism based on slider-crank mechanisms is utilized to achieve the rolling up and spreading motion. This mechanism precisely imitates three distinct curves that mimic the shape morphing of a pillbug. To decrease the degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the mechanism to one, scissor mechanisms are added. 3D curved shells are then attached to the tracer points of the morphing mechanism to safeguard it from attacks while allowing it to roll. Through type and dimensional synthesis, a complete system that includes shells and an underlying morphing mechanism is developed. A 3D model is created and tested to demonstrate the proposed system's shape-changing capability. Lastly, a robot with two modes is developed based on the proposed mechanism, which can curl up to roll down hills and can spread to move in a straight line via wheels.",

      "abstract": "There is a global need for BioImage Analysis (BIA) as advances in life sciences increasingly rely on cutting-edge imaging systems that have dramatically expanded the complexity and dimensionality of biological images. Turning these data into scientific discoveries requires people with effective data management skills and knowledge of state-of-the-art image processing and data analysis, in other words, BioImage Analysts. The Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) aims to enhance the profile of BioImage Analysts as a key role in science and research. Its vision encompasses fostering a global network, democratising access to BIA by providing educational resources tailored to various proficiency levels and disciplines, while also establishing guidelines for BIA courses. By collaboratively shaping the education of BioImage Analysts, GloBIAS aims to unlock the full potential of BIA in advancing life science research and to consolidate BIA as a career path. To better understand the needs and geographical representation of the BIA community, a worldwide survey was conducted and 291 responses were collected across people from all career stages and continents. This work discusses how GloBIAS aims to address community-identified shortcomings in work environment, funding, and scientific activities. The survey underscores a strong interest from the BIA community in activities proposed by GloBIAS and their interest to actively contribute. With 72% of respondents willing to pay for membership, the community's enthusiasm for both online and in-person events is set to drive the growth and sustainability of GloBIAS.",

Utilizing Electron Beam-Induced Current (EBIC) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy, these characteristics were examined as a function of both temperature and the duration of electron beam excitation. While the electron diffusion length in these p-Ga2O3 films diminish with increasing temperature, a continuous electron beam excitation of a particular location on the surface of a p-Ga2O3 epitaxial layer leads to an elongation of the diffusion length. and decay of cathodoluminescence intensity in that location under beam exposure. These latter two effects are attributed to non-equilibrium electrons, generated by an electron beam, being captured at acceptor-related point defect levels in Gallium Oxide. The activation energies characterizing these processes were obtained from the independent EBIC and CL experiments to garner insight into defect landscape and its influence on transport and recombination dynamics.",

Coupling a perturbative approach for low P\\'eclet numbers, measuring the relative importance of self-propulsion with respect to diffusion, with the renewal framework for the stochastic resetting process, we derive analytical expressions for the survival probability, the FPT probability density, and the associated low-order moments. Depending on their initial orientation, the minimal mean FPT for active particles to reach the boundary can both decrease and increase relative to the passive counterpart. The associated optimal resetting rates depend non-trivially on the initial distance to the boundary due to the intricate interplay of resetting, rotational Brownian noise, and active motion.",

      "abstract": "The function and dynamics of the cortex are fundamentally shaped by the specific wiring configurations of its constituent axonal fibers, also known as the connectome. However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical activity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating waves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's two-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local geometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics, despite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections (FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of activity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by developing a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which cortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional set of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the model across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales, we demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of rapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\\lessapprox 30~\\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous fluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\\text{ms}$), which increasingly resemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest that the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local (geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are context-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture rapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid processing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping slower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging).",

However, its application to the subcellular level remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of custom-shaped polymeric microstructures directly inside living cells using two-photon polymerization. A biocompatible photoresist is injected into live cells and selectively polymerized with a femtosecond laser. The unpolymerized photoresist is dissolved naturally within the cytoplasm, leaving behind stable intracellular structures with submicron resolution within live cells. We printed various shapes, including a $10 \\mu m$ elephant, barcodes for cell tracking, diffraction gratings for remote readout, and microlasers. Our top-down intracellular biofabrication approach, combined with existing functional photoresists, could open new avenues for various applications, including intracellular sensing, biomechanical manipulation, bioelectronics, and targeted intracellular drug delivery. Moreover, these embedded structures could offer unprecedented control over the intracellular environment, enabling the engineering of cellular properties beyond those found in nature.",

      "abstract": "Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to use a low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biology.",

Models of tissue biomechanics have been introduced to account for the coupling between mechanical response and biochemical processes. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the mechanical response of epithelial tissue is strongly anisotropic, with the degree of anisotropy being correlated with the existence of long range orientational order of cytoskeletal organization across the tissue. A theoretical framework is introduced that captures the dynamic feedback between tissue elastic response and cytoskeletal reorganization under stress. Within the linear regime for small and uniform applied strains, the shear modulus is effectively reduced by the nematic order in cytoskeletal alignment induced by the applied strain. This prediction agrees with experimental observations of epithelial response in lithographically patterned micro tissues.",

Stretchable functional materials are important components of strain sensors, and they are still major challenges for high performance strain sensors. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy of designing and optimizing flexible strain sensor by developing topological structure modulated high permittivity elastic nanocomposite. The topological structure with three-phase percolative nano-nanonetworks produces synergistic effects of space charge enhancement and local electric field modulation, and it gives rise to an ultrahigh dielectric permittivity (113.4, at 1 kHz, over 1500% enhancement than that of commercial elastic polyurethane matrix) and excellent comprehensive electromechanical performance, and the optimal comprehensive electromechanical performance reaches to 542.91 MPa-1, which is over 9-fold than that of commercial polyurethane elastic film. An interdigital capacitive strain sensor is designed using the topological structured elastic dielectric nanocomposite. It possesses high initial capacitance density and positive capacitance response with stain, achieving high signal-to-noise ratio, high capacitance response sensitivity, and wide linear range, and it breaks through disadvantages of negative sensitivity and narrow linear range for conventional interdigital strain sensors. The prepared integrated strain sensor arrays are able to measure local strain of convoluted surfaces and monitor the motion of soft actuators in real time, and they would make conditions for intelligent control systems and the study of morphological intelligence.",

Scattering responses vary with changing frequency; conversely, they remain unchanged at a constant frequency, which has been a long-standing limitation in the design of devices leveraging wave scattering phenomena. Here, we present metasurfaces that can scatter incident waves according to two variables - the frequency and pulse width - in multiple bands. Significantly, these scattering profiles are characterized by how the frequencies are used in different time windows due to transient circuits. In particular, with coupled transient circuits, we demonstrate variable scattering profiles in response to unique frequency sequences, which can markedly increase the available frequency channels in accordance with a factorial function. Our proposed concept, which is analogous to frequency hopping in wireless communication, advances wave engineering in electromagnetics and related fields.",

      "abstract": "Biocatalysis is an emerging field that provides an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional catalysis, but still it faces some challenges. One of the major difficulties for biocatalysts that require reactive species like H2O2 as co-substrates lies in the concentration of these reactive species. On the one hand, they are used as reactants, but on the other hand, they inactivate the enzymes at high concentrations. When utilizing non-thermal plasma to deliver H2O2 for biocatalysis, it is essential to understand the potential interactions between plasma-generated species (PGS) and enzymes. This is particularly important because, alongside \\ch{H2O2}, other reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals, atomic oxygen, superoxide, and nitric oxide are also produced. The investigation of the localized reactivity of the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of an enzyme, with certain species, is an important tool for predicting these interactions. In combination with reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations this enabled us to identify amino acid residues that are likely targets for modifications by the PGS. A subset of the theoretical predictions made in the present study were confirmed experimentally by mass spectrometry, underlining the utility of the SASA and MD based screening approach to direct time-consuming experiments and assist their interpretation.",

      "title": "Phase-field modelling of failure in ceramics with multiscale porosity",
      "abstract": "Many stiff biological materials exhibiting outstanding compressive strength/weight ratio are characterized by high porosity, spanning different size-scales, typical examples being bone and wood. A successful bio-mimicking of these materials is provided by a recently-obtained apatite, directly produced through a biomorphic transformation of natural wood and thus inheriting its highly hierarchical structure. This unique apatite (but also wood and bone) is characterized by two major distinct populations of differently-sized cylindrical voids, a porosity shown in the present paper to influence failure, both in terms of damage growth and fracture nucleation and propagation. This statement follows from failure analysis, developed through in-silico generation of artificial samples (reproducing the two-scale porosity of the material) and subsequent finite element modelling of damage, implemented with phase-field treatment for fracture growth. It is found that small voids promote damage nucleation and enhance bridging of macro-pores by micro-crack formation, while macro-pores influence the overall material response and drive the propagation of large fractures. Our results explain the important role of multiscale porosity characterizing stiff biological materials and lead to a new design paradigm, by introducing an in-silico tool to implement bio-mimicking in new artificial materials with brittle behaviour, such as carbide or ceramic foams.",

      "abstract": "Superconductors play a crucial role in the advancement of high-field electromagnets. Unfortunately, their performance can be compromised by thermomagnetic instabilities, wherein the interplay of rapid magnetic and slow heat diffusion can result in catastrophic flux jumps eventually leading to irreversible damage. This issue has long plagued high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn wires at the core of high-field magnets. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm aimed at tackling the complex intertwined effects of electromagnetism, heating, and strain acting concomitantly during the quenching process of superconducting coils. We validate our model by conducting comparisons with magnetization measurements obtained from short multifilamentary Nb$_3$Sn wires and further experimental tests conducted on solenoid coils while subject to ramping transport currents. Furthermore, leveraging our developed numerical algorithm, we unveil the dynamic propagation mechanisms underlying thermomagnetic instabilities (including flux jumps and quenches) within the coils. Remarkably, our findings reveal that the velocity field of flux jumps and quenches within the coil is correlated with the amount of Joule heating experienced by each wire over a specific time interval, rather than solely being dependent on instantaneous Joule heating or maximum temperature. These insights have the potential to pave the way for optimizing the design of next-generation superconducting magnets, thereby directly influencing a wide array of technologically relevant and multidisciplinary applications.",

      "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T<30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (>90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K. This method preserves the best qualities of SPE from WSe2 while increasing working temperature to more than three times the typical range. This work demonstrates the versatility of surface functionalization and heterostructure design to synergistically improve the properties of quantum emission and offers new insights into the phenomenon of SPE from 2D materials.",

      "abstract": "The OH-terminated self-assembled monolayers, as protein-resistant surfaces, have significant potential in biocompatible implant devices, which can avoid or reduce adverse reactions caused by protein adhesion to biomaterial surfaces, such as thrombosis, immune response and inflammation. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the degree of protein adsorption on the self-assembled monolayer terminated with two hydrophilic OH groups ((OH)2-SAM) at the packing densities ({\\Sigma}) of 4.5 nm-2 and 6.5 nm-2, respectively. The results show that the (OH)2-SAM itself can significantly improve the performance of its resistance to protein adsorption. This is attributed to the structure of the (OH)2-SAM itself, i.e., the formation of a nearly perfect hexagonal-ice-like hydrogen bond structure in the OH matrix of the (OH)2-SAM at {\\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2, which sharply reduces the number of hydrogen bonds (i.e., 0.9) formed between the hydrophobic (OH)2-SAM surface and protein. While for {\\Sigma} = 6.5 nm-2, the hydrophilic (OH)2-SAM surface can provide more hydrogen bonding sites to form hydrogen bonds (i.e., 7.3) with protein. The number of hydrogen bonds formed between the (OH)2-SAM and protein at {\\Sigma} = 6.5 nm-2 is ~8 times higher than that at {\\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2, reflecting the excellent resistance to protein adsorption exhibited by the structure of (OH)2-SAM itself at {\\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2. Compared with traditionally physical barrier effect formed by a large number of hydrogen bonds between the (OH)2-SAM and water above at {\\Sigma} = 6.5 nm-2, the structure of the (OH)2-SAM itself at {\\Sigma} = 4.5 nm-2 proposed in this study significantly improves resistance to protein adsorption, which provides new insights into the mechanism of resistance to protein adsorption on the (OH)2-SAM.",

      "abstract": "Nanostructured electrodes with voids or interconnected pores accommodate large volume changes, shorten ion diffusion pathways, and enhance the structural reversibility of alloying electrodes. While these nanoporous features improve the performance of architected electrodes over bulk electrodes, they also act as geometric irregularities that localize and concentrate internal stresses. In this work, we investigate the hierarchical interplay between phase boundaries and nanoporous features at the microstructural scale and their collective role in mitigating chemo-mechanical failure at the engineering scale. Using Sb$\\to$Li$_2$Sb$\\to$Li$_3$Sb as a model system, we develop a continuum framework coupling lithium diffusion and reaction kinetics with the finite deformation of alloying electrodes. We analytically show that large volume changes in the Sb$\\rightarrow$Li$_2$Sb transformation induce fracture, which nanoporous geometries can mitigate. Building on this, we develop a micromechanical model using a hyper-elastic neo-Hookean material law to predict the deformations accompanying the Li$_2$Sb$\\to$Li$_3$Sb transformation. Our results reveal how diffusion and reaction kinetics shape phase boundary morphology, identify crack geometries likely to propagate, and show how carefully architected electrodes relieve stresses. These findings highlight critical design principles to optimize electrode lifespan and demonstrate a potential application of our continuum model as an electrode design tool.",

      "abstract": "Legged robots have the potential to leverage obstacles to climb steep sand slopes. However, efficiently repositioning these obstacles to desired locations is challenging. Here we present DiffusiveGRAIN, a learning-based method that enables a multi-legged robot to strategically induce localized sand avalanches during locomotion and indirectly manipulate obstacles. We conducted 375 trials, systematically varying obstacle spacing, robot orientation, and leg actions in 75 of them. Results show that the movement of closely-spaced obstacles exhibits significant interference, requiring joint modeling. In addition, different multi-leg excavation actions could cause distinct robot state changes, necessitating integrated planning of manipulation and locomotion. To address these challenges, DiffusiveGRAIN includes a diffusion-based environment predictor to capture multi-obstacle movements under granular flow interferences and a robot state predictor to estimate changes in robot state from multi-leg action patterns. Deployment experiments (90 trials) demonstrate that by integrating the environment and robot state predictors, the robot can autonomously plan its movements based on loco-manipulation goals, successfully shifting closely located rocks to desired locations in over 65% of trials. Our study showcases the potential for a locomoting robot to strategically manipulate obstacles to achieve improved mobility on challenging terrains.",

The conventional wisdom is that the sticker dynamics control chain relaxation behavior, and hence the mechanical properties of associative vitrimers where the number of crosslinked sticker pairs is precisely constant over time. Instead, here we show that the chemical differences between sticker groups and nonsticky chain monomers can cause them to microphase separate. Under these conditions, the slow exchange of a sticker from one microphase to an adjacent one controls relaxation behavior. Controlling sticker aggregation is thus a key to tailoring the properties of these polymers with immediate relevance to a circular polymer economy.",

      "abstract": "Wurtzite ferroelectrics are rapidly emerging as a promising material class for next-generation non-volatile memory technologies, owing to their large remanent polarization, intrinsically ordered three-dimensional crystal structure, and full compatibility with CMOS processes and back-end-of-line (BEOL) integration. However, their practical implementation remains critically constrained by a severe endurance bottleneck: under conditions where the remanent polarization (2Pr) reaches or exceeds 200 uC/cm^2, devices typically undergo catastrophic failure before reaching 10^8 cycles. Here, we report a vacancy-confining superlattice strategy that addresses this limitation, achieving reliable ferroelectric switching beyond 10^10 cycles while preserving saturated polarization (2Pr >= 200 uC/cm^2). This is achieved by embedding periodic ultrathin AlN layers within AlScN films, forming wurtzite AlScN/AlN superlattices, in conjunction with a dynamic recovery protocol that actively stabilizes the defect landscape throughout repeated cycling. Atomic-resolution imaging and EELS spectrum imaging technique, supported by first-principles calculations, reveal a self-regulated defect topology in which nitrogen vacancies are spatially confined by heterostructure energy barriers and dynamically re-trapped into energetically favorable lattice sites. This dual spatial-energetic confinement mechanism effectively inhibits both long-range percolative migration and local defect clustering, enabling such an ultrahigh endurance exceeding 10^10 cycles and limiting polarization degradation to below 3% after 10^9 cycles. These findings establish nitrogen vacancy topology stabilization as a foundational design principle for reliable operation of wurtzite ferroelectrics, providing a scalable and CMOS-compatible platform for future high-endurance ferroelectric memory technologies.",

      "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.",

In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e. joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic systems of robotic locomotion.",

      "abstract": "Ribosomal protein S30 (RS30) exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Despite its efficacy, the underlying action mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we unravel the fundamental mechanism by which RS30 exerts its bactericidal effects, using a combination of microbiological assays and advanced biophysical techniques. Microbiological analyses reveal that RS30 kills bacteria primarily through membrane depolarization, despite limited membrane permeabilization, indicating an unconventional mode of action involving no or partial lysis of the membrane. Importantly, RS30 demonstrates time-dependent bactericidal activity with no detectable cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells, underscoring its high selectivity. This selective action was further confirmed using biophysical experiments on model membrane systems composed of anionic (bacterial mimic) and zwitterionic (mammalian mimic) phospholipids. Our measurements suggested that RS30 preferentially binds to anionic membranes via electrostatic interactions, undergoes a conformational transition from a random coil to an {\\alpha}-helix upon binding, and induces vesicle aggregation. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements provide microscopic insights, showing that RS30 significantly restricts the lateral diffusion of anionic lipids, thereby perturbing membrane dynamics and increasing susceptibility to external stress. Together, our findings uncover important insights into the antimicrobial action mechanism of RS30, characterized by selective membrane interaction, structural transformation, and dynamic modulation of lipid membranes.",

      "abstract": "During the life of animals, epithelial tissues undergo extensive deformations--first to form organs during embryogensis and later to preserve integrity and function in adulthood. To what extent these deformations resemble that of non-living elastic materials is not well understood. We derive an elasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular material and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are dominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical tension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level mechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the critical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue either buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of elasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the wrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in solid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the groove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial shape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory. Our work provides a guideline for understanding the relative role of cell surface tensions and the interaction of tissues with substrates during epithelial morphogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.",

      "abstract": "Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.",

      "abstract": "Colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to explore sliding friction phenomena in graphite contacts of nominal lateral size up to hundreds of nanometers. It is known that contact formation involves tribo-induced material transfer of graphite flakes from the graphitic substrate to the colloidal probe. In this context, sliding states with nearly-vanishing friction, i.e. superlubricity, may set in. A comprehensive investigation of the transfer layer properties is mandatory to ascertain the origin of superlubricity. Here we explore the friction response of micrometric beads, of different size and pristine surface roughness, sliding on graphite under ambient conditions. We show that such tribosystems undergo a robust transition towards a low-adhesion, low-friction state dominated by mechanical interactions at one dominant tribo-induced nanocontact. Friction force spectroscopy reveals that the nanocontact can be superlubric or dissipative, in fact undergoing a load-driven transition from dissipative stick-slip to continuous superlubric sliding. This behavior is excellently described by the thermally-activated, single-asperity Prandtl-Tomlinson model. Our results indicate that upon formation of the transfer layer, friction depends on the energy landscape experienced by the topographically-highest tribo-induced nanoasperity. Consistently we find larger dissipation when the tribo-induced nanoasperity is sled against surfaces with higher atomic corrugation than graphite, like MoS2 and WS2, in prototypical Van der Waals layered hetero-junctions.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.",

Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect.

We show that, within linear response and Debye-Huckel regime, the transport coefficients, and so the fluxes, can be significantly improved by the presence of a hydrophobic surface coating located at the narrowest section of the nanochannel. Our model indicates that the enhancement is larger when considering electric conductive walls in comparison to dielectric microchannel walls, and it is produced by a synergy between the entropic effects due to the geometry and the presence of the slip boundary layer.

Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers.

However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.",

We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets.

      "abstract": "Electrostatic adhesion is widely used in mobile robotics, haptics, and robotic end effectors for its adaptability to diverse substrates and low energy consumption. Force sensing is important for feedback control, interaction, and monitoring in the EA system. However, EA force monitoring often relies on bulky and expensive sensors, increasing the complexity and weight of the entire system. This paper presents an acoustic-pressure-based method to monitor EA forces without contacting the adhesion pad. When the EA pad is driven by a bipolar square-wave voltage to adhere a conductive object, periodic acoustic pulses arise from the EA system. We employed a microphone to capture these acoustic pressure signals and investigate the influence of peak pressure values. Results show that the peak value of acoustic pressure increased with the mass and contact area of the adhered object, as well as with the amplitude and frequency of the driving voltage. We applied this technique to mass estimation of various objects and simultaneous monitoring of two EA systems. Then, we integrated this technique into an EA end effector that enables monitoring the change of adhered object mass during transport. The proposed technique offers a low-cost, non-contact, and multi-object monitoring solution for EA end effectors in handling tasks.",

      "title": "Towards Biosignals-Free Autonomous Prosthetic Hand Control via Imitation   Learning",
      "abstract": "Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped, just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and unseen objects with a variation of weights. The demonstrations are available at \\href{https://sites.google.com/view/autonomous-prosthetic-hand}{https://sites.google.com/view/autonomous-prosthetic-hand}",

We, the authors, contacted A. El Hady and B. Machta for comment on the ideas presented herein. They suggested that we \"submit a Matters Arising Letter to Nature Communications and we will be asked to respond in due time.\" Nature Communications ultimately rejected the manuscript, citing:   \"... Our main criterion for consideration of Matters Arising is the degree to which the piece provides interesting and timely scientific criticism and clarification of a Nature Communications publication.

      "title": "Precise Fabrication of Uniform Molecular Gaps for Active Nanoscale   Devices",
      "abstract": "Molecules with versatile functionalities and well-defined structures, can serve as building blocks for extreme nanoscale devices. This requires their precise integration into functional heterojunctions, most commonly in the form of metal-molecule-metal architectures. Structural damage and nonuniformities caused by current fabrication techniques, however, limit their effective incorporation. Here, we present a hybrid fabrication approach enabling uniform molecular gaps. Template-stripped lithographically-patterned gold electrodes with sub-nanometer roughness are used as the bottom contacts upon which the molecular layer is formed through self-assembly. The top contacts are assembled using dielectrophoretic trapping of colloidal gold nanorods, resulting in uniform sub-5 nm junctions. In these electrically-active designs, we further explore the possibility of mechanical tunability. The presence of molecules may help control sub-nanometer mechanical modulation which is conventionally difficult to achieve due to instabilities caused by surface adhesive forces. Our approach is versatile, providing a platform to develop and study active molecular gaps towards functional nanodevices.",

      "abstract": "Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.",

After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.",
