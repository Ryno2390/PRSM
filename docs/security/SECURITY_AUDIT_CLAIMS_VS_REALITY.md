## üéØ Conclusion

PRSM has implemented a **genuinely strong enterprise security framework** that substantiates most security claims. The codebase demonstrates sophisticated security engineering with comprehensive authentication, authorization, safety systems, and audit capabilities.

The primary recommendation is to **adjust marketing language** to accurately reflect the current state: "Enterprise Framework Implemented" rather than "Complete," acknowledging that while the technical foundation is solid, formal compliance certifications and third-party validations are still in progress.

This honest representation will build greater trust with enterprise customers and investors while highlighting the significant security work already accomplished.
