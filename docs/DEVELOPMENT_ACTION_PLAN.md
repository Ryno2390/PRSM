# PRSM Development Action Plan: Consulting Report Implementation

**Based on:** AI Infrastructure Consulting Report Analysis  
**Prepared by:** PRSM Core Development Team  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Target:** Production-Ready AI Infrastructure Platform

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the comprehensive consulting report, we've identified **10 critical development tracks** that will transform PRSM from an advanced prototype into production-ready AI infrastructure. The report validates our architectural foundations while highlighting specific implementation gaps that prevent mainstream adoption.

**Key Insight:** Our theoretical framework and safety systems are production-grade, but we need to replace simulations with real distributed infrastructure and provide developer-friendly tooling.
