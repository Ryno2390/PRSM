PRSM Tokenomics Module
Enhanced FTNS token economy for context allocation and rewards

This module provides both simulation-based and database-backed FTNS implementations:
- ftns_service: Legacy simulation-based service (for testing/development)
- database_ftns_service: Production database-backed service
- models: Database models for FTNS token economy

The default export uses the database-backed service for production readiness.
