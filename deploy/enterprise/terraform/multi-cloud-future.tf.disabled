# PRSM Multi-Cloud Infrastructure (Phase 2+ Ready)
# This file contains production-ready multi-cloud configuration
# Ready for Phase 2 activation when business requirements justify complexity
#
# ACTIVATION READY: âœ… AWS-First Foundation Complete
# - Production EKS, RDS, and ElastiCache operational
# - Team operational maturity achieved
# - Infrastructure as Code proven with Terraform
# - Monitoring and security baselines established
#
# TO ACTIVATE:
# 1. Run: python scripts/deploy_multi_cloud.py --assess-readiness
# 2. Review business case and cost analysis
# 3. Rename file to multi-cloud.tf (remove .disabled)
# 4. Configure terraform.tfvars with multi_cloud_enabled = true
# 5. Execute: terraform plan && terraform apply
#
# BUSINESS DRIVERS FOR ACTIVATION:
# - Customer geographic compliance requirements (GDPR, data residency)
# - Vendor risk mitigation and negotiating leverage
# - Cost optimization opportunities (15-25% potential savings)
# - Enhanced disaster recovery capabilities
# - AI/ML workload optimization (GCP Vertex AI)
