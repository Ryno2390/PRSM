## üìù Description

The `prsm/core/models.py` file contains critical data models for PRSM but lacks comprehensive documentation. This module defines core classes like `UserInput`, `PRSMResponse`, and `ModelMetadata` that are essential for understanding how PRSM works.

**Current State**: The module has ~30 functions and classes with minimal or missing docstrings.

**What Needs Documentation**:
- `UserInput` class and its validation methods
- `PRSMResponse` class and response formatting
- `ModelMetadata` and performance tracking structures
- Error handling patterns and validation logic
- Usage examples for complex model interactions

This is perfect for learning PRSM's architecture while making a high-impact contribution that will help every future developer who works with PRSM!
