**Impact**: 🔥 High
**Mentorship Available**: Yes ✅

## 📝 Description

The `prsm/core/models.py` module is critical to PRSM's functionality but lacks comprehensive unit tests. This creates risk for regressions and makes it harder to safely refactor or extend the codebase.

**Current State**: The module has ~30 classes and functions with minimal test coverage.

**Tests to Create**:
- `UserInput` validation, serialization, and edge cases
- `PRSMResponse` data integrity and format validation  
- Error handling for malformed data
- Performance model metadata accuracy
- Integration between different model classes

**Why This Matters**: Good tests are crucial for maintaining code quality, preventing bugs, and enabling confident refactoring. This is an excellent way to learn the codebase deeply while contributing to its long-term maintainability.
