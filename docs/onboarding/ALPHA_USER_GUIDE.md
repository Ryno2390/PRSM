# Set up authentication
export PRSM_API_KEY="your_alpha_api_key"
export PRSM_ENDPOINT="https://alpha-api.prsm.ai"

# Or configure via CLI
prsm configure --api-key your_alpha_api_key --endpoint https://alpha-api.prsm.ai

# Test connection
prsm status
# Expected: Connected to PRSM Alpha Network (5 regions, 23 nodes)
```

### 4. Your First PRSM Query
```bash
# Simple query example
prsm query "Explain the concept of recursive neural networks and their applications in scientific modeling"

# Expected output:
# üéØ Query processed in 1.2s
# üí∞ Cost: 0.0023 FTNS tokens
# üåç Routed to: us-west-2 (local model: llama-3.2-1b)
# üìä Quality score: 0.89
# 
# [Detailed explanation of recursive neural networks...]
```

## üìñ Core Concepts

### 1. FTNS Tokens (Federated Token Network System)
FTNS tokens are the economic unit for PRSM operations:

```python
from prsm import PRSMClient

client = PRSMClient()

# Check your token balance
balance = client.get_balance()
print(f"Available tokens: {balance.balance} FTNS")
print(f"Current rate: ${balance.usd_rate} per token")

# Alpha users receive 1000 FTNS tokens for testing
# Typical query costs: 0.001-0.01 FTNS tokens
```

### 2. Hybrid Routing Strategies
PRSM intelligently routes queries based on multiple factors:

```python
# Privacy-first routing (keeps sensitive data local)
response = client.query(
    "Analyze this confidential business data: ...",
    routing_strategy="privacy_first"
)

# Cost-optimized routing (prioritizes local/free models)
response = client.query(
    "What's the weather like today?",
    routing_strategy="cost_optimized"
)

# Performance routing (uses best available models)
response = client.query(
    "Solve this complex differential equation: ...",
    routing_strategy="performance_first"
)
```

### 3. Model Capabilities
Access to diverse AI models through unified interface:

```python
# Code generation
code_response = client.generate_code(
    "Create a Python function for binary search",
    language="python",
    complexity="intermediate"
)

# Scientific analysis
analysis = client.analyze_data(
    data=research_dataset,
    analysis_type="statistical_correlation",
    output_format="detailed_report"
)

# Creative tasks
creative = client.generate_content(
    "Write a haiku about artificial intelligence",
    creativity_level=0.8,
    style="contemplative"
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Alpha Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Research Assistant
Test PRSM as an AI research assistant:

```python
import asyncio
from prsm import PRSMClient

async def research_workflow():
    client = PRSMClient()
    
    # Literature review
    literature = await client.search_literature(
        "quantum machine learning applications",
        max_papers=20,
        year_range=(2020, 2024)
    )
    
    # Hypothesis generation
    hypothesis = await client.generate_hypothesis(
        context=literature.summary,
        domain="quantum_ml",
        novelty_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    # Experimental design

        hypothesis=hypothesis.text,
        constraints={"budget": "$10k", "duration": "3 months"},
        methodology="computational"
    )
    
    return {
        "literature_count": len(literature.papers),
        "hypothesis_score": hypothesis.novelty_score,
        "experiment_feasibility": experiment.feasibility_score
    }

# Run the workflow
results = asyncio.run(research_workflow())
print(f"Research workflow completed: {results}")
```

### Scenario 2: Code Development Assistant
Use PRSM for software development tasks:

```python
from prsm import PRSMClient

client = PRSMClient()

# Code review and optimization
code = """
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""

review = client.review_code(
    code=code,
    language="python",
    review_aspects=["performance", "style", "security", "correctness"]
)

print(f"Code quality score: {review.overall_score}")
print(f"Suggestions: {review.suggestions}")

# Generate optimized version
optimized = client.optimize_code(
    code=code,
    optimization_goals=["performance", "memory_efficiency"],
    preserve_functionality=True
)

print(f"Optimized code:\n{optimized.code}")
print(f"Performance improvement: {optimized.improvement_metrics}")
```

### Scenario 3: Data Analysis Pipeline

    context="sales performance analysis",
    business_questions=[
        "What factors drive highest sales?",
        "Are there seasonal patterns?",
        "Which customer segments are most valuable?"
    ]
)

# Predictive modeling
model = client.build_predictive_model(
    data=data,
    target_column="sales_amount",
    model_type="auto_select",
    validation_strategy="time_series_split"
)

print(f"Model accuracy: {model.metrics.accuracy}")
print(f"Key insights: {insights.top_insights}")
```

### Scenario 4: Multi-Modal Analysis
Test PRSM's multi-modal capabilities:

from prsm import PRSMClient

client = PRSMClient()

# Analyze scientific paper (text + figures)
paper_analysis = client.analyze_document(
    file_path="research_paper.pdf",
    analysis_type="scientific_review",
    extract_figures=True,
    summarize_findings=True
)

# Cross-modal understanding
understanding = client.cross_modal_analysis(
    text=paper_analysis.abstract,
    images=paper_analysis.figures,
    task="validate_claims_against_visual_evidence"
)

print(f"Paper summary: {paper_analysis.summary}")
print(f"Figure analysis: {understanding.visual_validation}")
print(f"Consistency score: {understanding.consistency_score}")
```

## üìä Testing Metrics & Feedback

### Performance Tracking
Monitor your PRSM usage and provide feedback:

```python
from prsm import PRSMClient

client = PRSMClient()

# Get your usage statistics
stats = client.get_usage_stats(period="last_7_days")
print(f"Queries executed: {stats.total_queries}")
print(f"Average latency: {stats.avg_latency}ms")
print(f"Total cost: {stats.total_cost} FTNS")
print(f"Cost efficiency: ${stats.cost_per_query_usd}")

# Regional performance breakdown
regional_stats = client.get_regional_stats()
for region, metrics in regional_stats.items():
    print(f"{region}: {metrics.avg_latency}ms, {metrics.success_rate:.1%}")
```

### Quality Assessment
Rate the quality of responses to help improve PRSM:

```python
# Submit feedback after each query
response = client.query("Your question here")

feedback = client.submit_feedback(
    query_id=response.query_id,
    quality_rating=4,  # 1-5 scale
    accuracy_rating=5,
    usefulness_rating=4,
    comments="Response was accurate but could be more concise",
    suggested_improvements="Include more concrete examples"
)

print("Feedback submitted successfully")
```

### Bug Reports

```python
# Report a bug or issue
bug_report = client.report_issue(
    category="performance",  # performance|accuracy|routing|billing
    severity="medium",       # low|medium|high|critical
    description="Query timeout when using privacy_first routing",
    steps_to_reproduce=[
        "Set routing_strategy to 'privacy_first'",
        "Submit query longer than 500 characters",
        "Wait for timeout after 30 seconds"
    ],
    environment_info=client.get_environment_info()
)

print(f"Bug report ID: {bug_report.issue_id}")
```

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Model Integration
Integrate your own models into the PRSM network:

```python
from prsm import ModelRegistry

registry = ModelRegistry()

# Register a custom model
custom_model = registry.register_model(
    name="my_research_model",
    model_type="text_generation",
    framework="pytorch",
    model_path="/path/to/model",
    capabilities=["scientific_analysis", "hypothesis_generation"],
    cost_per_token=0.0001,
    hardware_requirements={"gpu": "V100", "memory": "16GB"}
)

# Make your model available to the network
registry.deploy_model(
    model_id=custom_model.id,
    regions=["us-west-2"],
    auto_scale=True,
    max_replicas=3
)
```

### 2. Workflow Automation
Create complex AI workflows:

```python
from prsm import Workflow, WorkflowStep

# Define a research workflow
workflow = Workflow("literature_review_workflow")

# Step 1: Search for papers
search_step = WorkflowStep(
    name="literature_search",
    action="search_literature",
    parameters={
        "query": "{research_topic}",
        "max_papers": 50,
        "include_preprints": True
    }
)

# Step 2: Analyze papers
analyze_step = WorkflowStep(
    name="paper_analysis",
    action="analyze_papers",
    parameters={
        "papers": "{literature_search.papers}",
        "analysis_depth": "detailed",
        "extract_methodologies": True
    },
    depends_on=["literature_search"]
)

# Step 3: Generate synthesis
synthesis_step = WorkflowStep(
    name="synthesis",
    action="synthesize_findings",
    parameters={
        "analyses": "{paper_analysis.results}",
        "output_format": "comprehensive_report"
    },
    depends_on=["paper_analysis"]
)

workflow.add_steps([search_step, analyze_step, synthesis_step])

# Execute workflow
result = workflow.execute(
    inputs={"research_topic": "federated learning in healthcare"},
    timeout=3600  # 1 hour
)

print(f"Workflow completed in {result.execution_time}s")
print(f"Final report: {result.outputs['synthesis']['report']}")
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Authentication Problems
```bash
# Issue: "Invalid API key" error
prsm auth verify

# If verification fails, re-configure
prsm configure --reset
# Re-enter your alpha API key

# Check environment variables
echo $PRSM_API_KEY
echo $PRSM_ENDPOINT
```

#### 2. Query Timeouts
```python
# Increase timeout for complex queries
client = PRSMClient(timeout=120)  # 2 minutes

# Or set per-query timeout
response = client.query(
    "Complex analysis task...",
    timeout=300,  # 5 minutes
    routing_strategy="performance_first"
)
```

#### 3. Regional Performance Issues
```python
# Check regional availability
status = client.get_network_status()
for region, health in status.regional_health.items():
    if health.availability < 0.9:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {region}: {health.availability:.1%} availability")

# Force specific region
response = client.query(
    "Your query",
    preferred_region="us-east-1"
)
```

#### 4. Token Balance Issues
```python
# Check token usage
usage = client.get_token_usage(period="today")
print(f"Used today: {usage.tokens_used} FTNS")
print(f"Remaining: {usage.tokens_remaining} FTNS")

# Request additional test tokens
token_request = client.request_test_tokens(
    amount=500,
    justification="Extended testing of multi-modal workflows"
)
print(f"Request status: {token_request.status}")
```
