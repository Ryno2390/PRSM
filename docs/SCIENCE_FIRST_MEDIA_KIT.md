# PRSM Media Kit: The End of Scarcity

## 🔬 Solving the Reproducibility Crisis
PRSM introduces **Deterministic Re-execution** to scientific modeling.
- **Problem:** Over 50% of published research is non-reproducible.
- **Solution:** Every research step in PRSM is cryptographically anchored and verifiable. Any node can re-run a "Reasoning Trace" to confirm the results, ensuring that science is a "Ledger of Truth," not a series of probabilistic guesses.

## 🌈 NWTN: The Physical Operating System
NWTN is the world's first AI model optimized for the physical world.
- **Multi-Core Brilliance:** Dynamically shifts between long-range specifications (SSM), atomic logic (SANM), and real-time kinetics (FSMN).
- **Edge Efficiency:** Designed to run on standard lab hardware, performing **Surprise Gating** to save 90% on bandwidth by only transmitting meaningful anomalies.
