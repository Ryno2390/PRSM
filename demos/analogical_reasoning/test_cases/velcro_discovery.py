Velcro Discovery Test Case
Specific test case demonstrating NWTN's rediscovery of Velcro through analogical reasoning

    The common burdock plant (Arctium minus) produces seed heads covered with hundreds
    of tiny hooks. Each hook is curved backward at the tip, creating a barb-like structure
    approximately 0.1 mm in length. These microscopic hooks are made of tough cellulose
    fibers that provide both strength and flexibility.
    
    When burdock seeds come into contact with animal fur or fabric, the hooks catch onto
    individual fibers and loop structures. The curved geometry of each hook creates a
    mechanical advantage that makes attachment strong, yet the flexibility of the material
    allows for eventual detachment when sufficient force is applied.
    
    The high density of hooks (approximately 150-300 per square millimeter) distributes
    the attachment load across many points, preventing any single hook from bearing
    excessive force. This distributed loading mechanism makes the overall attachment
    remarkably strong while maintaining reversibility.
    
    The attachment mechanism works best with fabrics that have a loop-like structure,
    such as wool or cotton, where individual hooks can penetrate between fibers and
    catch onto the fabric's natural texture. The angle of the hooks (typically 25-35
    degrees from vertical) provides optimal balance between grip strength and ease of
    detachment.
