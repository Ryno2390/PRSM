Creative Abductive Reasoning Engine for NWTN
===========================================

This module implements the Enhanced Abductive Engine from the NWTN Novel Idea Generation Roadmap Phase 5.
It transforms traditional abductive reasoning into **Creative Hypothesis Generation** for breakthrough explanations.

Architecture:
- WildHypothesisGenerator: Cross-domain borrowing, contrarian explanations, and metaphorical reasoning
- PlausibilityReranker: Balances conventional vs novel plausibility scoring
- BreakthroughPotentialEvaluator: Identifies moonshot ideas and unconventional explanations

Based on NWTN Roadmap Phase 5.1.1 - Enhanced Abductive Reasoning Engine (Highest Priority)
