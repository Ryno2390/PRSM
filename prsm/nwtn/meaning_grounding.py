NWTN Meaning-Grounding Validation System
Addresses the core "Form vs. Meaning" problem identified in Stochastic Parrots

This module ensures that NWTN's responses are grounded in genuine understanding
rather than sophisticated pattern matching. It validates that all outputs
can be traced back to first principles and demonstrate real comprehension.

Key concepts from Stochastic Parrots:
1. "Text generated by an LM is not grounded in communicative intent, 
   any model of the world, or any model of the reader's state of mind"
2. "Stochastic parrots haphazardly stitch together sequences of linguistic forms 
   without reference to meaning"
3. "The comprehension of implicit meaning is an illusion arising from 
   our singular human understanding of language"

NWTN's Response:
- All outputs must be traceable to first principles
- Causal relationships must be physically/logically plausible
- Understanding must transfer to novel scenarios
- Responses must demonstrate genuine comprehension, not just pattern matching
