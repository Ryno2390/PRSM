# Data Work Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Browser Compatibility Issue**
- **Problem**: Used `:has()` CSS selector which has limited browser support
- **Fix**: Replaced with compatible selector logic in `initializeDataWorkButtons()`

### 2. **Tab Navigation Issue**  
- **Problem**: Wrong selector for marketplace tab (`[data-section="marketplace"]` vs `[data-target="marketplace-content"]`)
- **Fix**: Updated selectors in `showDataWorkContent()` and `showDataWorkHub()`

### 3. **Get Started Button Logic**
- **Problem**: Complex onboarding logic prevented consistent navigation
- **Fix**: Simplified to always show "Get Started" button that navigates to Data Work Hub

### 4. **Missing Initialization**
- **Problem**: `addOnboardingTrigger()` not called during startup
- **Fix**: Added to `initializeDataWorkFunctionality()`

## Key Functions Updated:

### `initializeDataWorkButtons()` 
- Replaced `:has()` selectors with compatible button detection
- Fixed "Find Data Work" button to show filtered marketplace view

### `showDataWorkHub()`
- Added tab switching to ensure we're on marketplace tab
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved timing with setTimeout for tab switching

### `addOnboardingTrigger()`
- Simplified to always create "Get Started" button
- Button always navigates to Data Work Hub regardless of onboarding status

### `showDataWorkContent()`
- Fixed marketplace tab selector
- Added timing delay for tab switching

## Test Cases:

1. **"Get Started" button on Data Work card** → Should navigate to Global Data Work Hub
2. **"Find Data Work" button in Quick Actions** → Should show filtered marketplace with data work jobs  
3. **Data Work Asset Category card click** → Should show filtered marketplace with data work jobs
4. **Hub navigation should work from any tab** → Should switch to marketplace tab first

## Expected Behavior:

✅ **"Get Started" button** navigates to Global Data Work Hub  
✅ **Data Work card click** shows filtered marketplace with data work jobs  
✅ **"Find Data Work" button** shows filtered marketplace with data work jobs  
✅ Console logging helps debug any remaining issues  
✅ Browser compatibility improved by removing `:has()` selectors

## Files Modified:

- `js/script.js`: Main functionality fixes
- `css/style.css`: Added `.get-started-btn` styles
- Created test files for debugging: `test_navigation_flow.html`, `debug_get_started.html`
