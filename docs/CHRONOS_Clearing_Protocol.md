# CHRONOS Clearing Protocol

**CHRONOS** (Clearing House for Recursive Open Networks & Orchestrated Settlement) is a purpose-built clearing mechanism designed to support the settlement, conversion, and flow of tokens within the PRSM ecosystem. It acts as a trustless, high-throughput protocol for brokering between FTNS (Fungible Tokens for Node Support), Bitcoin, and fiat currencies (particularly USD), enabling cross-asset liquidity in a decentralized, secure, and scalable manner.

---

## 🏛 Institutional Structure

CHRONOS is envisioned as a **legally distinct financial entity**, majority owned and funded by Apple Inc., to avoid conflicts with its core hardware/software business while enabling strategic control over cross-asset liquidity flows that support PRSM.

- **Governance Model**: Apple as majority stakeholder, with remaining equity distributed among strategic contributors, exchanges, and institutional partners.
- **Custody Framework**: FTNS and Bitcoin reserves held in verifiable multi-sig wallets; fiat reserves held in Tier 1 bank custodial accounts.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Registered as a clearing authority in multiple jurisdictions with full AML/KYC compliance and audited transparency reports.

## 🔁 Clearing Mechanism

CHRONOS enables **real-time atomic swaps** between:

- **FTNS ↔ BTC** (via Lightning Network and/or native IOTA channels)
- **BTC ↔ USD** (via compliant institutional OTC partners or on-chain stablecoin bridges)
- **FTNS ↔ USD** (via dynamic multi-step routing)

This mechanism allows:

- Seamless monetization of FTNS rewards
- Market-making activity across PRSM
- Stable infrastructure funding
- Efficient redemption of token-based dividends

## 🔒 Settlement Protocol

Each transaction through CHRONOS follows a secure, layered process:

1. **Initiation**: User requests conversion or payment via Safari’s FTNS Broker (or other CHRONOS-compatible interface).
2. **Verification**: CHRONOS verifies the transaction provenance and confirms available liquidity.
3. **Atomic Swap**: Cross-chain, cryptographically secure asset conversion is executed using hashed time-lock contracts (HTLCs) or DAG-based equivalents.
4. **Ledger Update**: IPFS-based audit trail is updated with unique provenance hash.
5. **Notification & Confirmation**: User receives real-time confirmation of settlement.

## 🤝 Strategic Alignment
