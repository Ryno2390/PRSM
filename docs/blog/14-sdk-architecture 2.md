# SDK Design: Building Developer-Friendly AI APIs

*June 22, 2025 | PRSM Engineering Blog*

## Introduction

PRSM's Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide intuitive, powerful interfaces for integrating distributed AI capabilities. Our SDK design philosophy prioritizes developer experience while maintaining the flexibility and power needed for complex AI applications.

## SDK Architecture

### Multi-Language Support

PRSM provides native SDKs for popular programming languages:

```python
# Python SDK
from prsm_sdk import PRSMClient

client = PRSMClient(api_key="your-api-key")
result = await client.models.infer("gpt-4", "Hello, world!")
```

```javascript
// JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
import { PRSMClient } from '@prsm/sdk';

const client = new PRSMClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
const result = await client.models.infer('gpt-4', 'Hello, world!');
```

```go
// Go SDK
import "github.com/prsm-ai/prsm-go"

client := prsm.NewClient("your-api-key")
result, err := client.Models.Infer("gpt-4", "Hello, world!")
```

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Easy to get started with minimal configuration
2. **Consistency**: Uniform API patterns across all languages
3. **Flexibility**: Support for advanced use cases and customization
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing where possible
5. **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages

## Conclusion

PRSM's SDK design makes distributed AI accessible to developers while providing the power and flexibility needed for production applications. The combination of simplicity and capability enables rapid development and deployment of AI-powered applications.
