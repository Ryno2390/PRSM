# PRSM Audit Pipeline RFP Index

**Status (2026-05-06, post PRSM-POL-2):** All vendor-track RFPs drafted as of 2026-05-05 and **DEFERRED — funding-gated** per PRSM-POL-2 (Resource-Constrained Audit Strategy). RFP packets remain in tree as audit-trail evidence and as ready-to-fire artifacts when §5 revisit triggers fire. **L8 Track B (US securities counsel) is the sole non-deferred layer** — it remains a hard gate triggered by the first Prismatica investor solicitation regardless of broader budget posture.

> **Why deferred:** Combined budget is $280K–$645K. PRSM is currently a sole-founder, open-source, pre-funding project. The implicit "all audits clear before mainnet deploy" stance had become a project-freeze policy. PRSM-POL-2 (`docs/governance/2026-05-06-resource-constrained-audit-strategy.md`) ratified by PRSM-CR-2026-05-06-5 adopts agent-teams self-audit + OZ Pausable + TVL caps + 14-day public review window as the substitute mitigation framework for L3 and L4. Other layers are deferred with revisit triggers (POL-2 §5).

**Outreach packet:** [`outreach-emails.md`](outreach-emails.md) — one email per recipient (~22 firms across 8 RFPs), ready to copy/paste **once a §5 revisit trigger fires**. Do NOT execute outreach pre-trigger.

**Master plan:** `audits/AUDIT_PLAN.md` v1.1 (retains the layer-by-layer technical scoping; POL-2 governs scheduling/gating)
**Audit-strategy policy:** `docs/governance/2026-05-06-resource-constrained-audit-strategy.md` (PRSM-POL-2)
**Disclosure policy:** `SECURITY.md`

Channel A (Immunefi) deferred. |

**Total combined budget envelope: ~$280K - $645K.** Per POL-2, this envelope is held until §5 revisit triggers fire (e.g., first VC term sheet, FTNS market-cap > $1M, EscrowPool+StakeBond TVL > $50K, etc.).

## Sequencing — under PRSM-POL-2

POL-2 replaces the original "fire all RFPs in parallel now" plan with a **trigger-driven** schedule. RFPs fire when their §5 revisit trigger fires, not on a calendar schedule:

| Trigger | Fires |
|---|---|
| First serious VC engagement (term sheet or signed LOI) | L4 firm + L7 economic immediately |
| FTNS market cap > $1M | L4 firm + L7 within 30 days |
| EscrowPool + StakeBond combined TVL > $50K | L4 firm within 60 days |
| Tier C public availability requested | L5 ML supply chain before any non-self-hosted Tier C deployment |
| **First Prismatica investor solicitation** | **L8 Track B fires regardless of broader budget situation** |
| Foundation hires non-founder personnel | L8 Track A within 60 days |
| First disclosed-but-unremediated HIGH finding via security@ | Whatever audit layer covers the finding within 30 days |
| Any cash availability for audits before any §5 trigger | **L4 Code4rena first** (cheapest, broadest coverage) |
| Annual review of POL-2 (every 2026-05-06) | Council formally revisits all deferred layers |

**Critical:** until a trigger fires, founder bandwidth on these RFPs should be zero. The drafts are done; firing is fast (90 minutes for the full 22-email outreach packet) when the moment arrives.

## Status update protocol

When a vendor proposal arrives:

1. Update the relevant `Lx-*-rfp.md` with proposal-receipt date + vendor.
2. Add to `audits/AUDIT_PLAN.md` Lx status block.
3. After engagement letter signed: cross-link engagement letter from
   the RFP doc.
4. After report received: file under
   `audits/findings/Lx-<vendor>-<date>/` and update master plan.

When a vendor declines or is unavailable:

1. Note decline reason in the RFP doc (one line).
2. Move to next firm in the recipient list.
3. If all listed firms decline, escalate to council for next-step
   decision.
