## Key Concerns Identified

### üö© Critical (Red Flags)
1. **Unproven Network Effects** - Complex coordination never achieved at scale
2. **Missing Performance Benchmarks** - No evidence of advantages over centralized systems
3. **Bootstrap Paradox** - Requires simultaneous critical mass across stakeholders
4. **Technical Complexity vs UX** - Too complex for mainstream adoption
5. **Unvalidated Safety Mechanisms** - Distributed safety unproven under adversarial conditions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority (Yellow Flags) 
1. **Tokenomics Complexity** - Economic incentives may not align under stress
2. **Heavy External Dependencies** - IPFS, blockchain, consensus systems
3. **Quality Assurance at Scale** - No mechanism to prevent degraded models
