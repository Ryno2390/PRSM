# PRSM Custom Browser Architecture Proposal

## üéØ Vision: Native P2P Research Browser

A custom browser optimized for PRSM's P2P research collaboration protocols, providing seamless university-industry secure workflows without HTTP constraints.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Foundation

### Base Browser Selection
**Recommended**: Fork **Chromium** (not Chrome) for:
- ‚úÖ Open source with permissive licensing
- ‚úÖ Mature codebase with excellent documentation  
- ‚úÖ Strong security model and sandboxing
- ‚úÖ WebRTC/P2P capabilities already built-in
- ‚úÖ Active development community

**Alternative**: Consider **Gecko** (Firefox) for:
- ‚úÖ More permissive for custom protocols
- ‚úÖ Smaller, more hackable codebase
- ‚úÖ Better privacy defaults

## üîß Core Customizations

### 1. **Custom Protocol Handlers**
```cpp
// Native PRSM protocol support
prsm://quantum.unc.edu/paper/2024-qec-research
shard://distributed-file/quantum-algorithm-v2.pdf  
peer://discover/universities/computer-science
collab://session/multi-university-grant-proposal
```

### 2. **Integrated P2P Networking Stack**
```cpp
class PRSMNetworkStack {
    DHTPeerDiscovery peer_discovery;
    PostQuantumCrypto crypto_engine;
    ShardDistribution shard_manager;
    CollaborationEngine collab_engine;
    
    // Direct integration with browser's network layer
    void HandlePRSMRequest(const PRSMUrl& url);
    void EstablishP2PConnection(const PeerInfo& peer);
    void BeginSecureCollaboration(const SessionId& session);
};
```

### 3. **Enhanced Security Model**
- **Post-quantum crypto** built into browser core
- **Shard-based authentication** instead of traditional certificates
- **Multi-signature workflows** for institutional approvals
- **Zero-knowledge proof** integration for privacy

### 4. **Collaborative Interface Integration**
- **Real-time editing** without WebRTC limitations
- **Native file sharding** visualization
- **Peer network** topology display
- **Institutional approval** workflows

## üé® User Experience Design
