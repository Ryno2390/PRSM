# PRSM VC Deliverables Roadmap
## Technical Demonstrations to Validate Investment Thesis

### Executive Summary
This roadmap outlines concrete technical deliverables that demonstrate PRSM's core value propositions to potential seed investors. Focus is on **working demonstrations** rather than theoretical frameworks, addressing the chicken-and-egg funding challenge by proving technical competence and market viability.

### Primary Investment Validation Goals
1. **Prove analogical reasoning works** beyond sophisticated documentation
2. **Demonstrate SOC extraction creates real value** for researchers  
3. **Show MVP generates measurable research acceleration**
4. **Validate technical team execution capability**

## Phase 1: Constrained Analogical Reasoning Demo (Weeks 1-3)

### Objective
Build a working demonstration that takes a known scientific breakthrough and systematically discovers it through analogical reasoning from a different domain.

#### Demo Scenario: Velcro Discovery
**Source Domain**: Burdock plant burr attachment mechanism
**Target Domain**: Fastening technology
**Expected Analogical Insight**: Hook-and-loop fastening system

#### Core Components to Build

```python
class PatternExtractor:
    """Extract transferable patterns from source domain"""
    
    def extract_structural_patterns(self, domain_knowledge: str) -> List[StructuralPattern]
        # Extract physical structures (hooks, loops, surfaces)
    
    def extract_functional_patterns(self, domain_knowledge: str) -> List[FunctionalPattern]
        # Extract behaviors (adhesion, reversibility, mechanical attachment)
    
    def extract_causal_patterns(self, domain_knowledge: str) -> List[CausalPattern]
        # Extract cause-effect relationships (hook shape → grip strength)
```

**2. Cross-Domain Mapper** (`demos/analogical_reasoning/domain_mapper.py`)
```python

        # Map burdock hooks → synthetic hooks
    
    def validate_physical_feasibility(self, analogies: List[Analogy]) -> List[ValidatedAnalogy]
        # Check if material science supports the analogy
    
    def generate_testable_hypotheses(self, analogies: List[ValidatedAnalogy]) -> List[Hypothesis]
        # Create specific predictions about performance
```

**3. Hypothesis Validator** (`demos/analogical_reasoning/hypothesis_validator.py`)
```python
class HypothesisValidator:
    """Test analogical hypotheses against known outcomes"""
    
    def simulate_performance(self, hypothesis: Hypothesis) -> PerformanceMetrics
        # Predict adhesion strength, durability, etc.
    
    def compare_to_historical_outcome(self, prediction: PerformanceMetrics) -> ValidationResult
        # Compare to actual Velcro performance data
```
