Performance of the new method for ligand prediction is compared to\nthose of other available measures and to docking programs.

Recent advancements in pre-trained models for biomolecules have\ndemonstrated remarkable success across various biochemical applications,\nincluding drug discovery and protein engineering. However, in most approaches,\nthe pre-trained models primarily focus on the characteristics of either small\nmolecules or proteins, without delving into their binding interactions which\nare essential cross-domain relationships pivotal to SBDD. To fill this gap, we\npropose a general-purpose foundation model named BIT (an abbreviation for\nBiomolecular Interaction Transformer), which is capable of encoding a range of\nbiochemical entities, including small molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand\ncomplexes, as well as various data formats, encompassing both 2D and 3D\nstructures. Specifically, we introduce Mixture-of-Domain-Experts (MoDE) to\nhandle the biomolecules from diverse biochemical domains and\nMixture-of-Structure-Experts (MoSE) to capture positional dependencies in the\nmolecular structures. The proposed mixture-of-experts approach enables BIT to\nachieve both deep fusion and domain-specific encoding, effectively capturing\nfine-grained molecular interactions within protein-ligand complexes. Then, we\nperform cross-domain pre-training on the shared Transformer backbone via\nseveral unified self-supervised denoising tasks.
