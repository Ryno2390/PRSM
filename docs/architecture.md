# PRSM Architecture

The Protocol for Recursive Scientific Modeling (PRSM) is a decentralized, multi-agent AI framework designed to coordinate, execute, and refine complex scientific tasks through a recursive, parallelized system of lightweight models. This document provides an overview of PRSM’s architectural layers, agents, data routing, and integration with decentralized technologies.

---

## 🔧 Core Architectural Concepts

- **Recursive Decomposition ("Refraction")**: Complex user prompts are broken into successively smaller subtasks by a hierarchy of Architect AIs.
- **Parallel Execution**: Elemental tasks are processed simultaneously using a distributed network of lightweight, purpose-built models.
- **Decentralized Coordination**: All compute, data routing, and governance occur through decentralized infrastructure and peer-contributed resources.
- **Token-Gated Access**: PRSM’s core AGI, NWTN, consumes FTNS tokens to grant contextual reasoning and compute allocation.

---

## 🧠 NWTN: The Orchestrator AGI

**NWTN (Neural Web for Transformation Networking)** is the central orchestrator that mediates user queries and governs the distributed AI network. Its responsibilities include:

- Parsing and refining ambiguous user prompts
- Delegating prompt segments to the Architect AI hierarchy
- Routing tasks through Prompter, Router, and Compiler sub-AIs
- Reconstructing final outputs and reasoning chains
- Charging FTNS per unit of context requested

---

## 🏗️ Agent Layers

### 1. **Architect AIs**
- Recursive prompt decomposers
- Multiple levels of abstraction
- Transform user intent into subtasks via “refraction”

### 2. **Prompter AIs**
- Specialized in prompt engineering
- Translates subtasks into optimized queries
- Enhances alignment, context, and clarity

### 3. **Router AIs**
- Match tasks to available distilled sub-models
- Access the open marketplace of LLMs
- Fall back to commercial or open-source general LLMs if needed

### 4. **Sub-LLMs (Distilled AIs)**
- Lightweight, purpose-built models
- Hosted by participants across the network
- Continuously refined and governed via the PRSM teacher ecosystem

### 5. **Compiler AIs**
- Aggregate outputs from multiple sub-models
- Reconstruct answers and metadata for traceability
- Work in hierarchical chains (elemental → mid → final compiler)

---

## 🔁 Process Flow

1. **User Prompt → NWTN**
2. **NWTN Clarifies** → Passes to Level-1 Architect
3. **Refraction Process** → Subtasks → Lower-Level Architects
4. **Prompter AIs** optimize prompt construction
5. **Router AIs** assign tasks to best-fit sub-LLMs
6. **Parallel Execution** of tasks
7. **Compilers** merge output → Results percolate up architecture
8. **NWTN returns** final answer + transparency trace

---

## 🧩 Modular AI Components

- Each agent (Architect, Prompter, Router, etc.) can be:
  - Distilled and improved by the community
  - Hosted on local compute or edge networks
  - Replaced/upgraded based on performance

- Incentive for hosting or improving components:
  - Earn FTNS (Fungible Tokens for Node Support)
  - Gain governance voting weight
  - Access more NWTN context bandwidth

## ⚙️ FTNS Utility and Cost Model

- NWTN access requires FTNS, charged per unit of compute/context.
- Initial users receive FTNS grants but must contribute (storage, compute, novel data) to continue use.
- FTNS are earned via:
  - Hosting frequently accessed files (IPFS provenance)
  - Contributing useful research (judged by access rate, not subjective novelty)
  - Running pre/post-processing on edge devices
  - Distilling or improving sub-models

---

## 🔒 Safety and Governance

- Recursive decomposition inherently limits AGI generalization risks.
- Specialized sub-models lack broad capabilities.
- Any participant can trip a "kill switch" if unsafe models arise (Toyota-style assembly line halt).
- Open voting governs architectural upgrades and economic policy.
- Token-weighted votes with decay-based term limits.
- **Anonymous Governance**: Participants can vote and propose changes without revealing identities.
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Secure, anonymous channels for reporting safety concerns or misconduct.
- **Privacy-Preserving Audits**: Safety monitoring without compromising participant privacy or IP.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized architecture prevents single points of control or censorship.

---

## 📈 Future Expansion

- Forks of NWTN for enterprise/private use (e.g., internal Apple R&D instance)
- Real-time token micro-incentives based on usage metrics
- Modular plugin support for hardware interfacing, simulation, and robotics
