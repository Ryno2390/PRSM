# PRSM Validation Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Centralized evidence collection and validation pipeline to address technical reassessment findings

## Directory Structure

```

├── results/               # Timestamped test results and performance data
├── benchmarks/           # Comparative performance against GPT-4/Claude  
├── economic_simulations/ # Agent-based model execution results
├── safety_tests/         # Adversarial testing outcomes
└── network_deployments/  # Operational network evidence
```

## Evidence Standards

All validation evidence must include:
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format with timezone
- **Version**: Git commit hash of tested code
- **Environment**: Hardware, software, and network configuration
- **Methodology**: Detailed test procedure and parameters
- **Results**: Raw data, processed metrics, and statistical analysis
- **Verification**: Independent reproduction instructions

## Automation Pipeline

1. **Continuous Integration**: All tests run on code changes
2. **Scheduled Validation**: Daily comprehensive test suite execution  
3. **Evidence Archival**: Immutable storage with cryptographic verification
4. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time metrics and status reporting

## Access Control

- **Internal Team**: Read/write access to test execution and results
- **External Auditors**: Read-only access to historical evidence
- **Investors**: Curated dashboard with key metrics and trends
- **Public**: Summary statistics and methodology documentation
