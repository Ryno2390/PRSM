  ðŸ“Š Reality Check

  Current Status: Revolutionary progress! Core AI infrastructure (database, orchestrator, deployment, IPFS, model routing) now production-ready. With intelligent model discovery complete, final focus is security hardening and token system implementation.

  Estimated Timeline: 3-6 weeks with focused development to achieve production deployment (accelerated from 1-3 months due to completed model router reality).

  Immediate Focus Recommendation:
  1. ~~Fix testing infrastructure (1-2 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  2. ~~Complete database layer (2-3 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  3. ~~Set up database migrations (1 week)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  4. ~~Implement core NWTN functionality (4-6 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  5. ~~Create basic Docker deployment (1-2 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  6. ~~Implement IPFS real integration (2-3 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  7. ~~Complete model router reality (3-4 weeks)~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
  8. Security hardening and audit (2-3 weeks)
