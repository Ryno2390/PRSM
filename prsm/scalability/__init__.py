"""
PRSM Scalability Enhancement Package

Comprehensive scalability improvements addressing identified bottlenecks
in the system architecture. Includes intelligent routing, CPU optimization,
auto-scaling, and advanced caching.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
- Intelligent Routing: ✅ Core algorithms implemented
- CPU Optimization: ✅ Optimization strategies in place
- Auto-scaling: ✅ Scaling policies and metrics implemented
- Advanced Caching: ✅ Multi-level caching system operational

PERFORMANCE VALIDATION:
- User capacity limits: To be determined through load testing
- Throughput improvements: Pending production benchmarks
- Resource optimization: Awaiting production measurements
- Latency reduction: Performance gains to be validated
