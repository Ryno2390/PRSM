## Step 3: Creating Your First Agent

### 3.1 Understanding Agent Basics

An AI agent in PRSM is a self-contained component that can:
- Process tasks autonomously
- Make decisions based on data
- Communicate with other agents
- Learn from experience

### 3.2 Run the Simple Agent Example

```bash
python playground/examples/basic/simple_agent.py
```

### 3.3 Examine the Agent Code

Open `playground/examples/basic/simple_agent.py` and examine the key components:

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "SimpleAgent"):
        self.name = name
        self.capabilities = [
            "text_processing",
            "data_analysis", 
            "task_planning",
            "report_generation"
        ]
    
    async def process_task(self, task: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Task processing logic
        pass
```

### 3.4 Key Agent Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `async/await` for efficient execution
- **Multiple Capabilities**: Supports different types of tasks
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors performance and completion
- **Result Generation**: Returns structured results

### 3.5 Exercise: Customize Your Agent

Try modifying the agent to add a new capability:

1. Add "sentiment_analysis" to the capabilities list
2. Implement `_analyze_sentiment()` method
3. Add handling in `process_task()` method

## Step 4: P2P Network Basics

### 4.1 Understanding P2P Networks

PRSM's P2P network enables:
- **Decentralization**: No central authority required
- **Scalability**: Add nodes dynamically
- **Resilience**: Automatic failure recovery
- **Collaboration**: Agents can work together

### 4.2 Run the P2P Network Example

```bash
python playground/examples/p2p_network/basic_network.py
```

### 4.3 Network Components

#### **Nodes**
- Individual participants in the network
- Types: coordinator, worker, validator
- Each has unique ID and capabilities

#### **Connections**
- Peer-to-peer connections between nodes
- Automatic discovery and management
- Secure, encrypted communication

#### **Messages**
- Communication between nodes
- Types: discovery, task, consensus, heartbeat
- Cryptographically signed for security

### 4.4 Exercise: Explore Network Topology

1. Run the network example
2. Observe the node connections in the output
3. Note how nodes discover and connect to each other
