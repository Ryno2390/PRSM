## **Demo Script** *(8 minutes total)*

### **Demo Introduction** *(30 seconds)*

**Presenter**: *"Now I'd like to show you exactly how PRSM works with a real-world scenario that's directly relevant to the Research Triangle Park ecosystem. This is our live platform - not a mockup or simulation - running the same code that would be deployed in your environment."*

**[Screen Share: Switch to Interactive Demo Platform]**

**Presenter**: *"Our scenario: Dr. Sarah Chen from UNC Physics has developed a breakthrough quantum error correction algorithm. She wants to explore licensing opportunities with SAS Institute, but the algorithm is highly proprietary and represents years of research investment. Let's see how PRSM enables secure collaboration while protecting her IP."*

---

### **Step 1: Secure Workspace Creation** *(1.5 minutes)*

**[Click: "Create Secure Workspace" button]**

**Presenter**: *"First, Dr. Chen creates a secure collaboration workspace. Notice she's selecting 'High Security' mode - this triggers our '7-shard cryptographic splitting' that I mentioned earlier."*

**[Demo shows workspace creation form filling automatically]**

**Presenter**: *"The system immediately generates cryptographic keys and establishes P2P network nodes. Unlike traditional cloud platforms, there's no central server that can be compromised. The workspace exists as a distributed network of encrypted pieces."*

**[Point to real-time metrics showing]:**
- **7 Encryption Shards Created**
- **AES-256 Security Level** 
- **P2P Network Nodes: 12 Active**

**Presenter**: *"Key benefit for tech transfer offices: You can see the exact security level and encryption status for every collaboration. No more wondering 'is this secure enough for our most sensitive IP?'"*

**[Click: "Continue to File Upload"]**

### **Step 2: File Sharding & Distribution** *(1.5 minutes)*

**[Click on file upload area to trigger sharding animation]**

**Presenter**: *"Now Dr. Chen uploads her proprietary algorithm code. Watch what happens - this is the 'Coca Cola recipe' security model in action."*

**[Animation shows file being split into 7 encrypted pieces]**

**Presenter**: *"The 2.3 MB algorithm file is being split into 7 encrypted pieces, each with a unique encryption key. These pieces are distributed across the peer-to-peer network - some might be stored at UNC, others at Duke, others at NC State, and some with industry partners."*

**[Point to shard visualization showing distributed pieces]**

**Presenter**: *"Here's the critical point: To access this file, you need 5 of the 7 pieces PLUS the authorization keys. Even if someone compromises multiple network nodes, they can't reconstruct the algorithm without proper authorization."*

**[Highlight completed sharding status]:**
- **✓ 7 Shards Created**
- **✓ Distributed Across Network** 
- **✓ Unique Encryption Per Shard**
- **✓ Requires 5-of-7 + Authorization**

**Presenter**: *"For university administrators, this means zero single-point-of-failure risk. There's literally no 'server' that can be hacked to expose your researchers' IP."*

**[Click: "Add Collaborators"]**

---

### **Step 3: Collaborator Access Management** *(1.5 minutes)*

**[Demo shows adding collaborators with different permission levels]**

**Presenter**: *"Now comes the graduated access control - this is where PRSM really shines for university-industry partnerships."*

**[Point to Dr. Sarah Chen with full permissions]**

**Presenter**: *"Dr. Chen, as the principal investigator, has full access - view, edit, download. Standard academic freedom."*

**[Point to Michael Johnson (SAS) with limited permissions]**

**Presenter**: *"But Michael Johnson from SAS Institute - he's the industry evaluator - only gets 'view' and 'comment' permissions initially. He can see enough to assess commercial potential, but can't download or modify the proprietary code."*

**[Point to Tech Transfer Office access]**

**Presenter**: *"Your tech transfer office automatically gets audit access - you can see everything that happens without interfering with the research collaboration."*

**[Highlight key features]:**
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Precise control over who can do what
- **Time-Limited Access**: Industry evaluator permissions expire in 90 days
- **Graduated Disclosure**: Can upgrade permissions as trust builds
- **Automatic Stakeholders**: Tech transfer office included by default

**Presenter**: *"This solves the 'all or nothing' problem with current systems. You can let industry partners evaluate IP without giving away the store."*

**[Click: "Run AI Analysis"]**

### **Step 4: AI-Powered IP Analysis** *(2 minutes)*

**[NWTN AI analysis panel loads with simulated processing]**

**Presenter**: *"Here's where PRSM's AI integration becomes invaluable for tech transfer offices. Our NWTN AI system analyzes the quantum algorithm for commercial potential."*

**[Point to confidence meter filling to 87%]**

**Presenter**: *"87% confidence score - that's very high. The AI is analyzing market size, competitive landscape, technology readiness level, and potential licensing value."*

**[Read key analysis points]:**

**Presenter**: *"Look at these insights:*
- *Market potential: High - quantum computing growing at 32% annually*
- *Technology readiness: TRL 6 - ready for industry development*
- *Estimated licensing value: $2.5M to $5.2M initial deal plus royalties*
- *Key competitive advantage: 40% error reduction over current methods"*

**[Emphasize business value]**

**Presenter**: *"This analysis used to take weeks of manual research by tech transfer staff and external consultants. PRSM's AI delivers comprehensive market assessment in under 3 seconds."*

**[Point to recommendation section]**

**Presenter**: *"The AI recommends proceeding with industry partnership and suggests strong patent potential. For busy tech transfer offices managing hundreds of disclosures, this AI triage is transformational."*

**[Click: "View Audit Trail"]**

### **Step 5: Audit & Compliance Dashboard** *(1.5 minutes)*

**[Audit trail loads showing complete activity log]**

**Presenter**: *"Finally, let's look at the audit and compliance dashboard - this is critical for legal protection and regulatory requirements."*

**[Scroll through activity timeline]**

**Presenter**: *"Every single action is logged with timestamp, user identity, and detailed description. When your legal team needs to demonstrate due diligence in IP protection, you have complete documentation."*

**[Point to key metrics]:**
- **100% Activity Logged**
- **0 Security Breaches** 
- **3 Compliance Checks Passed**
- **2.1 Second Average Access Time**

**Presenter**: *"Notice the performance: 2.1 seconds average file access time despite the complex cryptographic security. Users don't sacrifice speed for security."*

**[Highlight compliance features]**

**Presenter**: *"The system automatically validates HIPAA requirements for medical research, ITAR compliance for defense work, and NSF data management plans for federally funded research. No more manual compliance checking."*

**[Point to export capability]**

**Presenter**: *"All of this data can be exported for legal discovery, university audits, or regulatory reporting. Your compliance team will love having complete, immutable audit trails."*

### **Demo Conclusion** *(30 seconds)*

**[Click: "Demo Complete" to show summary]**

**Presenter**: *"That's the complete workflow - from secure workspace creation to final compliance reporting. In less than 5 minutes, we've enabled a quantum computing researcher to safely collaborate with industry partners while maintaining complete IP protection and audit compliance."*

**[Summarize key benefits shown]:**

**Presenter**: *"What we've demonstrated:*
- *Zero server risk through cryptographic sharding*
- *Graduated access control for safe IP evaluation* 
- *AI-powered market analysis in seconds, not weeks*
- *Complete audit trails for legal protection*
- *Sub-3-second performance despite advanced security"*

**[Transition back to presentation]**

**Presenter**: *"This same platform is ready for deployment in your university environment, customized for UNC, Duke, or NC State workflows. Now let's talk about the business impact and implementation roadmap."*
