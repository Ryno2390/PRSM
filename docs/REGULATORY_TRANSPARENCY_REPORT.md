# PRSM Regulatory Transparency Report (2026)

## Executive Summary
This report details the architectural and economic design of the Protocol for Recursive Scientific Modeling (PRSM) to ensure compliance with global AI and data privacy regulations. PRSM is designed as a decentralized public good for scientific research, distinctly separated from commercial exploitation.

## 1. The SRO (Scientific Reputation Oracle) as a Fraud Prevention Tool
Contrary to financial speculation, the SRO is a fundamental security layer.
- **Verification, Not Speculation:** Linking real-world credentials (ORCID) to Non-Human Identities (NHIs) serves to verify scientific expertise.
- **Fraud Mitigation:** Higher trust multipliers are earned through peer-reviewed breakthroughs, making Sybil attacks financially and reputationally prohibitive.
- **Meritocracy:** This ensures that critical scientific validations are lead by verified experts, upholding the integrity of the Universal Research Commons.

## 2. Non-Profit Foundation vs. Commercial Integration
- **PRSM Foundation:** Operates the core protocol, manages the Moonshot Fund, and oversees governance as a public good.
- **Prismatica:** A separate for-profit entity that provides commercial-grade industrial integration and private shard services.
- **Regulatory Firewall:** This separation ensures that the protocol itself is not classified as a security, but as a neutral infrastructure for scientific inquiry.

## 3. Data Sovereignty and PII Protections
- **ZKP Data Masking:** Researchers prove data usage without exposing plaintext sensitive information.
- **Compliance-as-Code:** Automated agents scan for global legal updates (e.g. EU AI Act) and instantly adjust ethical kill-switches at the edge.
