# Add SDK Error Handling Documentation and Examples

**Labels**: documentation, good first issue, priority: high, beginner-friendly, python-sdk, help wanted

---
**Type**: Documentation
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê (1/4 stars)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Skills Needed**: Python, Documentation, Error Handling, SDK Design
**Impact**: üî• High
**Mentorship Available**: Yes ‚úÖ

## üìù Description

The Python SDK needs comprehensive error handling examples to help developers build robust applications with PRSM. Currently, while the SDK has good error types, there aren't enough practical examples showing how to handle different scenarios.

**Examples to Create**:
1. **Rate Limiting**: How to handle `PRSMRateLimitError` with exponential backoff
2. **Budget Management**: Graceful handling of `PRSMBudgetExceededError`
3. **Authentication**: Dealing with expired tokens and auth failures
4. **Network Issues**: Timeout handling and connection errors
5. **Validation Errors**: Input validation and error recovery

**Impact**: This will significantly improve the developer experience and help users build production-ready applications with proper error handling.
