## Recent Development Notes
- All Phase 2 automation systems operational
- RLT system maintaining 100% success rate
- Monitoring dashboards provide real-time visibility
- Quality gates established for ongoing development
- Ready for Phase 3 advanced optimization work

## Technical Debt
- 3 high-severity security issues (can be addressed during Phase 3)
- Some system metrics collection using fallbacks (non-critical)
- Documentation updates needed for new automation systems
