# PRSM x Apple: Hungry Nodes Architecture

## Executive Summary

**Hungry Nodes** represent a strategic innovation in Apple's PRSM partnership that transforms their IPFS infrastructure investment from a cost center into a revenue-generating asset. These Apple-maintained backup nodes automatically capture and monetize orphaned provenance when original content owners delete their PRSM contributions.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- 🔄 **Revenue Recovery**: Convert sunk IPFS infrastructure costs into ongoing income streams
- 🛡️ **Content Preservation**: Ensure scientific knowledge permanence in the PRSM ecosystem  
- 📈 **Economic Efficiency**: Generate passive income from existing Apple infrastructure
- 🌐 **Network Resilience**: Provide failsafe backup for critical research data

## Conceptual Framework

### The Orphaned Provenance Problem

When researchers publish work to PRSM and later delete their content:
1. **Provenance chain breaks** - downstream dependencies become invalid
2. **Scientific knowledge loss** - potentially valuable research disappears 
3. **Economic waste** - FTNS tokens and computational investment lost
4. **Network instability** - broken links reduce PRSM reliability

### Hungry Nodes Solution

Apple's Hungry Nodes act as **provenance scavengers** that:
1. **Monitor deletion events** across the PRSM network
2. **Automatically claim ownership** of orphaned content within grace periods
3. **Maintain content availability** through Apple's IPFS infrastructure
4. **Generate revenue streams** from rescued provenance ownership

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Provenance Transfer Mechanism

```python
class ProvenanceTransferEvent(BaseModel):
    """Triggered when original owner deletes content"""
    original_owner_id: str
    content_hash: str
    deletion_timestamp: datetime
    grace_period_hours: int = 72  # 3-day grace period
    provenance_value: Decimal      # Estimated FTNS value
    dependencies: List[str]        # Downstream content depending on this
    
class HungryNodeClaim(BaseModel):
    """Apple node's claim on orphaned content"""
    apple_node_id: str
    content_hash: str
    claim_timestamp: datetime
    original_provenance_value: Decimal
    rescue_justification: str      # Why this content is valuable to preserve
    new_ownership_terms: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 2. Automated Content Rescue Pipeline

```python
class HungryNodeManager:
    """Manages Apple's hungry node network for content rescue"""
    
    async def monitor_deletion_events(self):
        """Continuously monitor PRSM for content deletions"""
        async for deletion_event in prsm_event_stream:
            if deletion_event.type == "CONTENT_DELETION":
                await self.evaluate_rescue_opportunity(deletion_event)
    
    async def evaluate_rescue_opportunity(self, event: ProvenanceTransferEvent):
        """Evaluate whether to claim orphaned content"""
        # Calculate rescue value
        rescue_score = await self.calculate_rescue_value(event)
        
        if rescue_score > self.rescue_threshold:
            await self.initiate_hungry_claim(event)
    
    async def calculate_rescue_value(self, event: ProvenanceTransferEvent) -> float:
        """Calculate value of rescuing orphaned content"""
        factors = {
            "citation_count": await self.get_citation_count(event.content_hash),
            "dependency_count": len(event.dependencies),
            "original_ftns_investment": float(event.provenance_value),
            "content_uniqueness": await self.assess_uniqueness(event.content_hash),
            "scientific_impact": await self.assess_impact_score(event.content_hash)
        }
        
        # Weighted scoring algorithm
        score = (
            factors["citation_count"] * 0.3 +
            factors["dependency_count"] * 0.25 +
            factors["original_ftns_investment"] * 0.2 +
            factors["content_uniqueness"] * 0.15 +
            factors["scientific_impact"] * 0.1
        )
        
        return score
```

### 3. IPFS Infrastructure Repurposing

Apple's existing IPFS spine can be efficiently repurposed:

```yaml
# Apple IPFS Infrastructure Reallocation
Original IPFS Purpose:
  - Content distribution for PRSM users
  - Decentralized storage backbone
  - Network resilience and redundancy

Hungry Nodes Repurposing:
  - 70% Original PRSM distribution
  - 20% Hungry node content rescue
  - 10% Apple revenue optimization storage
```

### 4. Revenue Generation Models

#### A. Provenance Licensing
```python
class ProvenanceLicensing:
    """Revenue from licensing rescued content"""
    
    licensing_models = {
        "academic_access": {
            "price_per_citation": Decimal("0.1"),  # FTNS per citation
            "bulk_license_discount": 0.15
        },
        "commercial_usage": {
            "base_fee": Decimal("5.0"),            # FTNS base fee
            "usage_multiplier": 2.5                # Higher rates for commercial use
        },
        "derivative_works": {
            "royalty_percentage": 0.05,            # 5% of derivative work revenue
            "minimum_payment": Decimal("1.0")
        }
    }
```

#### B. Content Preservation Services
```python
class PreservationServices:

    service_tiers = {
        "basic_preservation": {
            "monthly_fee": Decimal("0.5"),         # FTNS per month
            "guarantee_years": 5,

- 15% rescue rate (1,500 rescues/month)
- Average rescue value: 8 FTNS
- Average licensing revenue: 2 FTNS/month per rescued item

Monthly Revenue:
- New rescues: 1,500 × 8 = 12,000 FTNS
- Existing licensing: Growing portfolio × 2 FTNS/item

```

**Aggressive Scenario (Years 3-5):**
```
Assumptions:
- 50,000 content deletions/month (network growth)
- 25% rescue rate (strategic targeting)
- Average rescue value: 15 FTNS (better targeting)
- Licensing portfolio: 40,000+ rescued items

Annual Revenue:
