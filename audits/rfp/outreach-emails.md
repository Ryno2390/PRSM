# Vendor Outreach Email Packet

**Purpose:** Ready-to-send drafts for the 8 vendor-track RFPs in
`audits/rfp/`. One section per RFP; one email block per recipient.

**Author:** Ryne Schultz, Founder, PRSM Foundation
**From:** schultzryne@gmail.com (Cc: security@prsm.network)
**PGP:** see [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md)

---

## How to use this packet

1. **Verify the recipient address before sending.** Most large
   firms route cold inquiries through web intake forms rather than
   public email. For each recipient I list either (a) a known
   intake address, or (b) the firm's intake URL with a note "verify
   contact path." When in doubt, use the intake form — it routes to
   business-development faster than a generic info@ inbox.
2. **Send each RFP's emails in the same business day.** Parallel
   solicitation is disclosed in each email; sending them on
   different days creates information asymmetry between recipients.
3. **Track replies in `audits/rfp/README.md` per the status-update
   protocol** (§ "Status update protocol" at the bottom of that
   file).
4. **Attach nothing.** Each email links the relevant RFP via the
   public GitHub URL. Firms expect to read the scope on their own
   time; attaching PDFs reduces the response rate.

**Repository URL convention:**
`https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/<file>.md`

---

## Sequencing (from `audits/rfp/README.md`)

Send order over ~2 business days:

**Day 1 morning** — L4 (firm + Code4rena), L3 (gates audit-bundle
clear)
**Day 1 afternoon** — L8 Track B (US securities), L8 Track A (Cayman)
**Day 2 morning** — L5 (ML), L7 (economic)
**Day 2 afternoon** — L6f (infrastructure)

L9 (Immunefi bounty) is **NOT** in this packet — its activation is
gated POST-L4 clear. Send the L9 outreach email post-2026-08-15
target.

### To: **Trail of Bits** (intake form: <https://www.trailofbits.com/contact/>)

**Subject:** RFP — PRSM audit-bundle Solidity review (Base mainnet, ~2,300 SLOC, $60K-$80K, 3 weeks)

Hi Trail of Bits team,

I'm Ryne Schultz, founder of the PRSM Foundation (Cayman Islands
nonprofit). PRSM is a decentralized research / storage / modeling
protocol with smart contracts deployed on Base mainnet — see
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM>.

We are issuing a firm pair-review RFP for our audit-bundle (~2,300
SLOC across 9 contracts: EscrowPool, StakeBond, BatchSettlementRegistry,
RoyaltyDistributor v2, EmissionController, CompensationDistributor,
StorageSlashing, KeyDistribution, Ed25519Verifier wrapper). We've
already completed an internal multi-team adversarial review (1
CRITICAL + 7 HIGH + 7 MEDIUM all remediated) and a pre-engagement
artifact pack so your reviewers can start with a clean baseline.

**Full RFP:**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L4-firm-rfp-addendum-20260505.md>

Budget envelope: $60K-$80K. Target window: 2026-06-09 → 2026-07-07.

We are also soliciting proposals from Spearbit/Cantina and OpenZeppelin
in parallel. Our preference is one of you for the firm slot + the
public Code4rena contest as concurrent coverage.

Trail of Bits is on our shortlist specifically for your prior work on
Base / OP Stack chains and your published Ed25519 reviews (separate L3
crypto-specialist engagement may also interest your cryptography
practice — see `audits/rfp/L3-ed25519-crypto-rfp.md`).

Could we schedule a 30-minute scoping call this week or next? I can
share a Calendly or pick a time that works for your team.

**Budget:** ~$40K target prize pool
**Window:** 14-day public contest (target 2026-06-09 → 2026-06-23)
**Recipient:** Code4rena intake

---

### To: **Code4rena** — intake@code4rena.com

**Subject:** Contest scoping — PRSM audit-bundle (Base mainnet, ~2,300 SLOC, ~$40K pool)

Hi Code4rena team,

I'd like to scope a public contest for the PRSM audit-bundle —
~2,300 SLOC across 9 Solidity contracts deploying to Base mainnet.

PRSM is a decentralized research / storage / modeling protocol; the
in-scope contracts cover an escrow pool, provider stake bond, batch
settlement registry, royalty distributor (v2 pull-payment),
emission controller, compensation distributor, storage slashing,
key distribution, and an Ed25519 verifier wrapper.

**Pre-engagement state:**
- Internal multi-team adversarial review CLOSED — 1 CRITICAL + 7 HIGH
  + 7 MEDIUM all remediated.
- L1 static + symbolic tooling (Slither + Aderyn + Mythril) wired in
  CI; clean as of 2026-05-05.
- Concurrent L3 crypto-specialist engagement on the Ed25519 + SHA-512
  primitives (separate scope).
- Concurrent firm pair-review (Trail of Bits / Spearbit / OZ).

**Scoping packet (in-scope files, known-non-bugs, attack-surface
priority list):**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L4-code4rena-contest-scope.md>

**Target:** ~$40K prize pool, 14-day contest window 2026-06-09 →
2026-06-23 (negotiable based on your scheduling).

What's your typical onboarding flow + lead time from "let's do it" to
contest live? Happy to do a scoping call.

Thanks,

# §3 — L3 Cryptographic Specialist Audit (Ed25519 + SHA-512)

**RFP:** `audits/rfp/L3-ed25519-crypto-rfp.md`
**Budget:** $15K – $30K
**Window:** 2-4 weeks, target 2026-05-26 start
**Recipients:** Trail of Bits Cryptography + NCC Group Cryptography

---

### To: **Trail of Bits Cryptography practice** (intake form: <https://www.trailofbits.com/contact/> — note "Cryptography" in routing)

**Subject:** RFP — Ed25519 + SHA-512 Solidity verifier review (~1,274 LoC, $15K-$30K, 2-4 weeks)

Hi Trail of Bits Cryptography team,

I'm Ryne Schultz, founder of the PRSM Foundation. We're seeking a
**cryptography-specialist firm** (not generic smart-contract review)
for a focused audit of an on-chain Ed25519 + SHA-512 implementation.

**Scope (~1,274 LoC):**
- `Ed25519Lib.sol` — 887 LoC, hand-rolled Solidity port of
  `chengwenxi/Ed25519` (Apache-2.0)
- `Sha512.sol` — 328 LoC
- `Ed25519Verifier.sol` — 59 LoC integration wrapper

**Why specialist:** the verifier is on the INVALID_SIGNATURE
challenge path of our batch-settlement protocol. A signature
malleability bug, compression edge case, or curve-arithmetic bug
maps directly to economic loss. We need reviewers with prior
published work on Ed25519 / Curve25519 / FIPS 180-4 — your team's
record on similar primitives is exactly the fit.

**Pre-engagement work already done** so you can start clean:
- RFC 8032 + FIPS 180-4 test-vector harness
- Upstream port diff vs `chengwenxi/Ed25519`
- Caller-assumptions memo

**Full RFP:**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L3-ed25519-crypto-rfp.md>

Budget: $15K-$30K. Target start: 2026-05-26. We are also soliciting
NCC Group Cryptography Services in parallel.

Could we schedule a 30-minute scoping call this week?

### To: **NCC Group Cryptography Services** (intake: <https://www.nccgroup.com/us/contact-us/> — note "Cryptography Services")

**Subject:** RFP — Ed25519 + SHA-512 Solidity verifier review (~1,274 LoC, $15K-$30K, 2-4 weeks)

Hi NCC Group Cryptography Services team,

I'm Ryne Schultz, founder of the PRSM Foundation. We're seeking a
cryptography-specialist firm for a focused review of an on-chain
Ed25519 + SHA-512 verifier (~1,274 LoC of curve-arithmetic + hash
code) deploying to Base mainnet.

The verifier is on our INVALID_SIGNATURE challenge path; a
malleability bug, compression edge case, or curve-arithmetic mistake
maps directly to economic loss. We need reviewers with published
prior work on Ed25519 / Curve25519 — NCC Cryptography Services'
record on similar primitives is the fit.

**Scope:**
- `Ed25519Lib.sol` — 887 LoC, Solidity port of `chengwenxi/Ed25519`
  (Apache-2.0)
- `Sha512.sol` — 328 LoC
- `Ed25519Verifier.sol` — 59 LoC integration wrapper

**Pre-engagement artifacts ready:** RFC 8032 + FIPS 180-4 test-vector
harness, upstream port diff, caller-assumptions memo.

**Full RFP:**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L3-ed25519-crypto-rfp.md>

Budget: $15K-$30K. Target start: 2026-05-26. We are soliciting Trail

# §4 — L8 Track B: US Securities Counsel

**RFP:** `audits/rfp/L8-legal-counsel-rfp.md` Track B
**Budget:** $50K – $150K initial + ongoing retainer
**Window:** 8 weeks initial opinion + ongoing
**Recipients:** Cooley + Lowenstein Sandler + DLx Law

---

### To: **Cooley LLP** (route through firm intake: <https://www.cooley.com/contact> — preferably to a partner in the Digital Assets / Blockchain practice)

**Subject:** Engagement inquiry — PRSM Foundation (Cayman) + Prismatica (DE C-corp) US securities counsel, Reg D 506(c) raise + FTNS classification

Dear Cooley team,

I'm Ryne Schultz, founder of the PRSM Foundation, a Cayman Islands
nonprofit foundation operating the PRSM protocol — a decentralized
research / storage / modeling network with smart contracts on Base
mainnet.

We are seeking US securities counsel for two related matters:

1. **FTNS token classification.** Howey-test analysis of the FTNS
   utility token, given the protocol's two-entity design (Foundation
   nonprofit + Prismatica DE C-corp). We have an internal working
   memo and would value an outside-counsel opinion before mainnet
   public availability.

2. **Reg D 506(c) Prismatica equity raise.** Prismatica is the
   for-profit operating arm; the capital raise is structured as
   equity in Prismatica (NOT FTNS), with general-solicitation
   exemption under 506(c). We need form documents (PPM / sub
   docs / Form D / accredited verification flow) and counsel
   throughout.

**Full RFP (both tracks):**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L8-legal-counsel-rfp.md>

Budget envelope: $50K-$150K initial + ongoing retainer. Target start:
within 4 weeks of engagement letter signed.

We are soliciting Lowenstein Sandler and DLx Law in parallel for
Track B (US securities), and a separate Track A panel (Mourant /
Walkers / Ogier) for Cayman counsel.

Cooley is on our shortlist for your depth in token-issuer matters
and the Foundation/operating-company two-entity structures common in
the space. Could we schedule a 30-minute intro call?

Best regards,
Ryne Schultz
Founder, PRSM Foundation

nonprofit). PRSM is a decentralized research / storage / modeling
protocol on Base mainnet, with a two-entity design: Foundation
nonprofit + Prismatica (Delaware C-corp) operating arm.

We are seeking US securities counsel for two matters:

1. **FTNS token classification** — Howey-test outside-counsel
   opinion before mainnet public availability.
2. **Reg D 506(c) Prismatica equity raise** — equity in Prismatica
   (not FTNS), 506(c) general-solicitation exemption, full form-doc
   support.

**Full RFP:**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L8-legal-counsel-rfp.md>

Budget envelope: $50K-$150K initial + ongoing retainer. Target start:

### To: **Trail of Bits ML/AI Assurance practice** (intake form: <https://www.trailofbits.com/contact/> — note "Machine Learning Assurance" in routing)

**Subject:** RFP — PRSM off-chain ML pipeline audit (~28K LoC Tier 1 + ~7K LoC Tier 2, $40K-$80K, 4-6 weeks)

Hi Trail of Bits ML team,

I'm Ryne Schultz, founder of the PRSM Foundation. PRSM is a
decentralized inference / royalty / settlement protocol; the off-
chain side is a ~28K-LoC Python pipeline covering tensor-parallel
+ Parallax-style sharded inference, RPC + handoff tokens,
streaming generators, manifest DHT, and per-tier privacy controls
(Tier B/C TEE gating).

The audit-bundle smart contracts cover the on-chain settlement
side; this L5 engagement covers the off-chain ML supply-chain side
that on-chain auditors typically don't have ML systems-security
background to address.

**Full RFP (8 audit dimensions including model-supply-chain
integrity, activation extraction, KV-cache cross-tenant isolation,
Tier C constant-time properties, threshold-key distribution
integrity, receipt forgery, etc.):**
<https://github.com/Ryno2390/PRSM/blob/main/audits/rfp/L5-ml-supply-chain-audit-rfp.md>

# §9 — Cadence + reply tracking

After sending: log each send into `audits/rfp/README.md` § "Status
update protocol" with date, recipient, and the engagement-letter
status. Suggested cadence:

- **Day 3:** light follow-up if no acknowledgment.
- **Day 7:** second follow-up if still no reply.
- **Day 14:** treat as no-response and proceed to the next firm in
  the recipient list (per the README's protocol).

When a proposal arrives, cross-reference budget + timeline against
the RFP envelope, then schedule the scoping call. Engagement letters
are signed at PRSM-POL-1 §5.1 disbursement authority (founder + 1
council signer on the Foundation Safe).
