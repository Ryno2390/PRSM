## üìù Description

PRSM needs a comprehensive GitHub label system to help organize issues and improve contributor experience. The labels should cover:

**Priority Labels:**
- `priority: critical`, `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`

**Type Labels:**
- `type: bug`, `type: feature`, `type: documentation`, `type: enhancement`

**Component Labels:**
- `component: core`, `component: sdk`, `component: ui`, `component: auth`, `component: marketplace`

**Difficulty Labels:**
- `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `advanced`, `expert`

**Status Labels:**
- `status: needs triage`, `status: in progress`, `status: blocked`, `status: ready for review`

This task involves:
1. Researching label best practices for open source projects
2. Creating the label system in GitHub
3. Documenting the labeling strategy
4. Setting up label automation (if possible)
