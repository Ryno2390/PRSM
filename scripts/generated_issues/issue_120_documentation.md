## 📝 Description

The module `venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pip/_internal/operations/build/__init__.py` is currently empty or has minimal content. This file should contain:

1. A module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the module
2. Proper imports and exports (if applicable)
3. Module-level constants or configuration (if needed)

**Current content:**
```python

```

This is an excellent task for understanding Python module structure and PRSM's architecture.
