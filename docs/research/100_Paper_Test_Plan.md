## Practical Schedule

### Saturday Morning (3 hours)
- Tasks 1-4: Setup, selection, testing
- Validate pipeline works end-to-end

### Saturday Afternoon (4 hours)
- Task 5: Process all 100 papers
- Monitor progress and handle any issues

### Saturday Evening (1 hour)
- Tasks 6-8: Extract patterns, test discoveries, analyze
- Document results and plan next phase

## Success Criteria

1. End-to-end pipeline works without errors
2. SOC extraction quality >70%
3. Pattern extraction generates meaningful patterns
4. Storage stays under 3GB total
5. Processing completes in <8 hours

## Deliverables

1. ~260 patterns extracted from real papers
2. Working automated pipeline
3. Quality metrics and performance data
4. 1-2 discovery demonstrations

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### PROCEED TO 1K PAPERS IF:
- âœ… Pipeline completed without major errors
- âœ… SOC extraction quality â‰¥70%
- âœ… Generated â‰¥200 meaningful patterns
- âœ… At least 1 compelling discovery demonstration
- âœ… Storage and performance within expected parameters

### RED FLAGS - STOP AND FIX:
- ðŸ›‘ Frequent pipeline failures or errors
- ðŸ›‘ SOC extraction quality <50%
- ðŸ›‘ Patterns are mostly duplicates or nonsensical
- ðŸ›‘ No discoverable cross-domain mappings
- ðŸ›‘ Performance dramatically worse than expected

### Decision Matrix

**All Criteria Met**
- Decision: FULL GO - Proceed to 1K papers immediately
- Confidence: High
- Investment: $327 for next phase

**Most Criteria Met**
- Decision: CONDITIONAL GO - Fix issues then proceed
- Confidence: Medium
- Investment: Additional debugging time + $327

**Mixed Results**
- Decision: ITERATE - Improve pipeline with same 100 papers
- Confidence: Low
- Investment: Time investment, no additional cost

**Poor Results**
- Decision: PIVOT - Reassess approach or abandon
- Confidence: Very Low
- Investment: Sunk cost of $32.70

## Exponential Scaling Roadmap

### Phase 1: Micro Test (100 papers)
- **Cost**: $32.70
- **Duration**: 8h
- **Cumulative Patterns**: 260

### Phase 2: Mini Scale (1,000 papers)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Failures (Medium Probability, High Impact)
- Start with very small test (10 papers) before 100
- Test each component separately first
- Have backup processing approach ready
- Document all errors for debugging

### Quality Issues (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- Manual validation of first 10 SOC extractions
- Compare results to known high-quality patterns
- Adjust extraction parameters if needed
- Use multiple validation approaches

### Cost Overruns (Low Probability, Low Impact)
- Monitor API usage in real-time
- Set hard limits on spending
- Have backup cheaper processing methods
- Start with free papers where possible

### Storage Issues (Low Probability, Medium Impact)
- Aggressive cleanup of temporary files
- Compress data where possible
- Stream processing to minimize storage
- Cloud backup option ready

### Performance Issues (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- Start processing overnight/weekend
- Optimize batch sizes for performance
- Have cloud processing backup ready
- Profile bottlenecks early

## Immediate Action Plan

### This Week Preparation
1. **Set up development environment**
   - Update existing codebase from our demos
   - Test API access and rate limits
   - Verify storage space available

2. **Paper selection preparation**
   - Research high-value arXiv categories
   - Identify 100 recent biomimetics/materials papers
   - Validate papers are accessible and high-quality

3. **Success metrics definition**
   - Define what 'good' SOC extraction looks like
   - Prepare validation datasets
   - Set up monitoring and logging

### Weekend Execution
- **Friday Evening**: Final preparation and testing
- **Saturday**: Full 100-paper test execution
- **Sunday**: Analysis, demos, and next phase planning

### Decision Point
- **Sunday Evening**: Go/No-Go decision for 1K paper phase
- **If GO**: Start 1K papers the following weekend
- **If NO-GO**: Iterate on issues with same 100 papers

## Executive Summary

- **Investment**: $32.70, 8 hours
- **Expected Outcome**: ~260 patterns, 2+ discoveries
- **Success Rate**: High (low-risk, well-defined scope)
- **Next Phase**: 1K papers for $327 if successful
- **Ultimate Goal**: 100K+ papers, commercial discovery engine

## Recommendation
