# PRSM Browser - Native P2P Research Browser

## 🎯 Vision

The world's first browser optimized for P2P research collaboration, providing native support for PRSM's distributed, post-quantum secure academic workflows.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
# Install dependencies
./scripts/install_deps.sh

# Build PRSM Browser
./scripts/build.sh

# Run development version
./scripts/run_dev.sh
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Protocol Layer**: Native `prsm://`, `shard://`, `collab://` support
- **P2P Networking**: Integrated DHT and distributed file sharing
