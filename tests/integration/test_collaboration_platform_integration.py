PRSM Collaboration Platform Integration Tests
===========================================

Comprehensive integration testing for the complete P2P secure collaboration platform,
including all four major components:

1. Cryptographic File Sharding Engine
2. Enhanced Collaboration UI (backend validation)
3. Jupyter Notebook Collaboration
4. Technology Transfer IP Evaluation Workflow

These tests simulate real-world university-industry collaboration scenarios
in the RTP ecosystem.

Code Analysis and Suggestions:

**Code Quality**: Good structure and documentation
**Performance**: Consider vectorization for the matrix operations
**Security**: No sensitive data exposed in code
**Best Practices**: Follow PEP 8 formatting standards

**Optimization Suggestions**:
1. Use numpy.einsum for efficient tensor operations
2. Implement caching for repeated calculations
3. Add type hints for better maintainability

**Potential Issues**:
- Memory usage could be optimized for large matrices
- Error handling could be more robust

# Quantum Error Correction for NISQ Devices

## Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to quantum error correction specifically designed
for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Our algorithm demonstrates
a 40% improvement in error correction efficiency compared to existing methods.

## Proprietary Algorithm
The core innovation lies in our adaptive error correction scheme that dynamically
adjusts to the noise characteristics of different quantum hardware platforms.

## Results
Experimental validation on IBM quantum devices shows significant performance
improvements in both error rate reduction and computational overhead.
