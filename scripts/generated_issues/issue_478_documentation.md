## üìù Description

The Python SDK needs comprehensive error handling examples to help developers build robust applications with PRSM.

**Examples to Add:**
1. **Rate Limiting Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       result = await client.infer(prompt="Hello")
   except PRSMRateLimitError as e:
       # Wait and retry logic
       time.sleep(e.retry_after)
       result = await client.infer(prompt="Hello")
   ```

2. **Budget Management**
   ```python
   try:
       result = await client.infer(prompt="Hello")
   except PRSMBudgetExceededError as e:
       print(f"Budget exceeded. Remaining: ${e.remaining_budget}")
       # Handle gracefully
   ```

3. **Authentication Errors**
4. **Network/Timeout Errors**
5. **Validation Errors**

**Files to Update:**
- `sdks/python/README.md`
- `sdks/python/examples/error_handling.py`
- `sdks/python/docs/error_handling.md`

This helps developers build production-ready applications!
