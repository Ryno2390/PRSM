- **Audit Trails**: Complete transparency and traceability

### **Distributed System Security**
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Resilience against malicious nodes
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Model integrity validation
- **Secure P2P Communication**: Encrypted network protocols
- **Identity Management**: Secure user and node authentication

### **Data Protection**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving research data handling
- **IPFS Security**: Content-addressed storage with integrity verification
- **Access Controls**: Token-based authorization and permissions
- **Data Provenance**: Complete tracking of data lineage

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **For Security Issues**

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. **Report privately** via GitHub Security Advisories: 
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/PRSM-AI/PRSM/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"

2. **Email directly** for urgent issues:
   - Send to: security@prsm-project.org (if available)
   - Include "PRSM SECURITY" in the subject line

### **Information to Include**

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: What kind of security issue is this?
- **Affected Components**: Which PRSM components are impacted?
- **Attack Vector**: How could this vulnerability be exploited?
- **Impact Assessment**: What damage could result from exploitation?
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### **Response Timeline**

We are committed to addressing security issues promptly:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification  
- **7 days**: Detailed analysis and remediation plan
- **30 days**: Security fix implementation and testing
- **Public disclosure**: After fix deployment and affected users notification

## üîç Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No              |

**Note**: As PRSM is currently in beta, we focus security efforts on the main release branch. Upon stable release, we will maintain security support for the latest major version and the previous major version.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### **For Users**

#### **Environment Security**
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv prsm-env
source prsm-env/bin/activate

# Keep dependencies updated
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Verify checksums for downloaded models
```

#### **Configuration Security**
```python
# Never commit API keys or secrets
# Use environment variables for sensitive data
import os
api_key = os.getenv('PRSM_API_KEY')

# Enable safety monitoring
safety_config = {
    'strict_mode': True,
    'audit_logging': True,
    'circuit_breaker_enabled': True
}
```

#### **Network Security**
- **Use HTTPS/TLS** for all API communications
- **Verify peer identities** in P2P network participation
- **Monitor node behavior** for suspicious activity
- **Keep software updated** with latest security patches

### **For Developers**

#### **Code Security**
```python
# Input validation
async def process_query(self, user_input: str) -> PRSMResponse:
    # Validate and sanitize all inputs
    validated_input = self.safety_monitor.validate_input(user_input)
    
    # Use parameterized queries for data access
    # Never construct queries with string concatenation
    
    # Implement proper error handling
    try:
        result = await self.orchestrator.process(validated_input)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log security events without exposing sensitive data
        self.security_logger.warning("Query processing failed", 
                                    extra={"user_id": user_id, "error_type": type(e).__name__})
        raise
```

#### **Dependency Management**
```bash
# Regular security audits
pip-audit

# Dependency scanning
safety check

# Keep dependencies minimal and updated
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
```

### **For Node Operators**

#### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Isolate PRSM processes** using containers or VMs
- **Monitor system resources** for unusual usage patterns
- **Implement network firewalls** with minimal required ports
- **Regular security updates** for operating system and dependencies
- **Backup and recovery** procedures for critical data

#### **P2P Network Participation**
- **Verify peer reputations** before accepting connections
- **Monitor consensus participation** for Byzantine behavior
- **Report suspicious nodes** to the network governance
- **Maintain node security** with regular audits

    await breaker.trigger_emergency_halt(
        threat_level=safety_assessment.threat_level,
        reason="Potential security threat detected"
    )
```

#### **Access Control**
```python
# Token-based authorization
from prsm.tokenomics.ftns_service import FTNSService

ftns = FTNSService()
user_balance = await ftns.get_balance(user_id)

if user_balance < required_tokens:
    raise InsufficientFundsError("Access denied: insufficient FTNS tokens")
```

#### **Data Integrity**
```python
# Cryptographic verification
from prsm.data_layer.enhanced_ipfs import PRSMIPFSClient

ipfs = PRSMIPFSClient()
content, metadata = await ipfs.retrieve_with_provenance(content_id)

# Verify content integrity
if not ipfs.verify_integrity(content, metadata['hash']):
    raise IntegrityError("Content integrity verification failed")
```
