## Game-Theoretic Investment Opportunity: The Coordination Singularity

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Advanced%20Prototype-blue.svg)
![Inevitability](https://img.shields.io/badge/economics-Mathematically%20Inevitable-gold.svg)
![Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/updated-2025--06--18-orange.svg)

**Investment Thesis**: PRSM represents economic inevitability, not market speculation—multiple game-theoretic forcing functions make adoption mathematically certain  
**Target**: Strategic investors who understand coordination infrastructure, network effects, and platform capture dynamics  
**Core Insight**: Not betting on technology adoption—betting on economic rationality and investor capital recovery pressure

> **⚠️ TRANSPARENCY DISCLAIMER**: PRSM is currently an **advanced prototype** with working demonstrations of core concepts. Investment opportunity is based on prototype validation + clear development roadmap, not production claims. All performance metrics clearly categorized as **Measured** (actual), **Target** (design capacity), or **Theoretical** (optimized projections).
