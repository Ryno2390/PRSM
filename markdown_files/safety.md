# PRSM Safety Architecture

PRSM is designed with safety and alignment at the core of its architecture. In a world where powerful AI systems can be misused or misaligned, PRSM offers a federated, transparent, and decentralized alternative to traditional centralized AI systems.

## 🔒 Why Safety Matters

Most advanced AI models today are:

- Trained behind closed doors
- Controlled by a small number of actors
- Capable of performing general tasks with limited oversight
- Vulnerable to abuse, model collapse, or unintended emergent behavior

PRSM flips this model on its head by design.

---

## 🧱 Safety Through Modularity

Rather than deploying one massive, general-purpose AGI, PRSM decomposes intelligence into:

- Specialized, task-specific sub-models
- Controlled data scopes
- Limited interfaces for execution

This “fractured” approach limits single-point failure and reduces the risk of broad, unchecked generalization.

---

## 🌀 Recursive Task Decomposition

PRSM uses recursive refraction of complex prompts into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is:

- Limited in scope and input/output
- Routed to the most relevant, distilled model
- Audited independently before recombination

This makes it nearly impossible for a single malicious subtask to produce large-scale harm.

---

## 📡 Torrent-Like Federation with Circuit Breakers

All AI components in PRSM are distributed across user devices using a torrent-inspired protocol. Each participant:

- Hosts small shards of models or data
- Can cut off connections (“trip a circuit breaker”) if a safety concern is detected
- Votes on updates to models via a consensus system

> Any node can halt execution if something seems “off”—like a Toyota factory worker stopping the line.

## 🔁 Teacher Distillation with Verifiable Rewards

PRSM uses a unique training methodology:

- Distilled “teacher” models guide sub-AIs via specialized curricula
- Curricula are scored via RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)
- Teachers that produce aligned students are rewarded with FTNS

This creates decentralized, bottom-up model alignment without relying on a central authority.

---

## 🔍 Provenance Tracking via IPFS

All information ingested into PRSM is tracked via cryptographic content hashes:

- Verifies where data came from
- Allows participants to “blacklist” or downrank harmful sources
- Supports royalty payments tied to usage frequency

Transparent origins make it easier to trace and respond to misuse.

---

## 🗳️ Open Governance & Contention Protocols

- Any decision (e.g., flagging misuse, modifying system logic) goes through open, term-based votes
- Users can flag AGI outputs they believe are unsafe or incorrect
- “Contention credits” allow users to challenge judgments, triggering human or multisig review

This ensures no single user or node dominates the system’s ethical decisions.

---

## 🧩 Functional Limitations of Sub-AIs

Most PRSM models are:

- Small, distilled, and purpose-built
- Lacking broad general capabilities
- Focused on tight domains (e.g., modeling catalysts, simulating energy flows)

Their usefulness comes from orchestration, not individual capability—limiting the impact of any rogue model.

---

## 🧬 Evolutionary Pressure for Alignment

Because sub-models are evaluated based on:

- Their performance
- Their composability with other models
- Their trustworthiness

…aligned models naturally outperform misaligned ones.

> In PRSM, safety is a competitive advantage—not a constraint.

---

## 🧯 Built-In Redundancy & Refutation Layers

For every output, PRSM records:

- The reasoning path
- All supporting subtasks and results
- Confidence scores from each model

Users can audit any decision, trace errors, or propose better alternatives.

---

## 🧭 Summary: Safety by Architecture

PRSM does not rely on “alignment patches” bolted onto centralized systems. Instead, it uses:

- Modular design
- Recursive task flow
- Torrent-based federation
- Verifiable training incentives
- Provenance tracking
- Contention and governance frameworks

…to create a system where misaligned models can’t thrive, and the community governs its own tools.

PRSM is aligned not because it’s watched—but because its structure makes alignment the path of least resistance.
