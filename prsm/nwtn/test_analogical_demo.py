Our approach utilizes advanced tensor calculus and differential geometry to model quantum phenomena in gravitational fields. The method demonstrates how quantum fields propagate through curved spacetime, revealing fundamental connections between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We derive new equations that govern quantum field evolution in curved backgrounds and show how these lead to novel predictions for particle creation near black holes. The framework provides a unified mathematical structure for understanding quantum effects in strong gravitational fields.",
