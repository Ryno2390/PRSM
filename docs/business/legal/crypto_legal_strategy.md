# Crypto & Legal Setup Strategy for FTNS within the PRSM Ecosystem

## üîê Overview

This document outlines the legal and regulatory strategy for launching and maintaining FTNS (Fungible Tokens for Node Support), the native incentive token of the PRSM protocol. This strategy ensures:

- Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions
- Functional clarity of the token (utility vs. security)
- A pathway to exchange listings
- Protection for contributors, operators, and investors
- Strong governance foundations

## üßæ 1. Token Classification Strategy

### Objective:
Ensure FTNS is categorized as a **utility token** and not a security in key jurisdictions (US, EU, Singapore, etc.).

### Approach:
We adopt the **"function-first" doctrine** from global crypto regulators: FTNS earns its utility status by being *used* within the PRSM protocol for:

- Purchasing context in NWTN queries
- Paying for compute/storage access on the decentralized network
- Earning rewards for data contribution and usage (provenance)

### Key Precedents:
- **Howey Test (USA)** ‚Üí Focus on avoiding "expectation of profit from the efforts of others"
- **MiCA (EU)** ‚Üí Align with "utility token" or "asset-referenced token" categories
- **MAS (Singapore)** ‚Üí Submit advance token classification for sandbox if needed

## üß† 2. Entity Structuring

### Objective:
Isolate liability, manage regulatory scope, and enable future DAO transition.

### Structure:

| Entity | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **PRSM Labs** (Delaware C-Corp) | Operating company | Software dev, team payroll, grant admin |
| **FTNS Foundation** (Cayman or Swiss Verein) | Non-profit foundation | Token issuance, governance, public goods |
| **CHRONOS LLC** (Separate Entity) | Clearing entity | Handles cross-asset settlement (FTNS/BTC/USD) |
| **Prismatica Inc.** | For-profit subsidiary | APM commercialization, internal IP development |

### Why this works:
- Keeps **token operations separate** from for-profit activities
- Allows **regulatory engagement** through foundation channels
- Enables **DAO transition** post-token distribution

## ‚öñÔ∏è 3. Jurisdictional Compliance

### US Strategy (High Risk)
- FTNS tokens *not sold directly* to US residents
- Adopt **"access-based" model** (users earn/use tokens through participation)
- Implement robust **Terms of Use**, disclaimers, and **geofencing** as fallback

### EU Strategy (MiCA-compatible)
- Register FTNS under utility token exemption or sandbox pathway
- Provide **Proof of Use** documentation
- Token rewards framed as **network credits**, not speculative assets

### APAC & Others
- Prioritize **Singapore** for token-friendly regulation
- Review **Japan**, **South Korea**, and **UAE** for secondary exchange partnerships

## üìú 4. Smart Contract & Token Governance

### Token Standards:
- Launch on **IOTA‚Äôs ShimmerEVM** or EVM-compatible testnet
- Use ERC-20-compatible format for exchange compatibility

### Governance Design:
- Token-weighted DAO with **vesting**, **circuit breakers**, and **multi-sig upgrades**
- Implement **"proof of use" participation locks** to avoid mercenary liquidity
- Legal wrapper: Swiss Foundation or Cayman with DAO-transparency commitments

## üíº 5. Launch Strategy

### No Public ICO / IDO
- Avoid public sale to reduce legal complexity
- Distribute via:
  - Node rewards (staking compute/storage)
  - Contribution rewards (data uploads, model distillations)
  - Partner grants for ecosystem tools

### Vesting Schedule
- **Team**: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- **Investors**: 2-year vesting with milestone unlocks
- **Foundation Treasury**: Unlocked on governance vote
- **Reserve**: For protocol liquidity & exchange listings

## üè¶ 6. Exchange Strategy

### Short-Term: Utility-Only Access
- FTNS redeemable within PRSM only
- No liquidity pool created until post-compliance

### Mid-Term: Strategic Listings
- Work with crypto-native exchanges (e.g. Gate.io, KuCoin, OKX)
- Publish **legal opinion letters** validating utility token status
- Apply to exchanges with **compliance-light listing pathways**

### Long-Term: Broker-Relayer Integration
- Partner with CHRONOS as regulated clearing entity
- Integrate Safari relay wallet as native token interface
- Enable BTC/USD/FTNS atomic swaps via IOTA Streams or similar

## üìë 7. Legal Partners

### Suggested Firms:
- **DLx Law** (US, SEC-focused crypto compliance)
- **COALA Network** (Swiss, EU-compliant token structures)
- **Meridian 180** (APAC/US dual strategy)
- **Chainalysis** (for on-chain compliance tools)

Engage legal counsel no later than **Q3 2025**, ahead of exchange listing and token unlock.

## üîÅ Ongoing Compliance Practices

- Publish **quarterly transparency reports** (token issuance, burn, usage)
- Integrate **on-chain compliance tools** for KYC-free behavior analysis
- Establish **auditable treasury tracking** for FTNS flows
- Launch **"provenance fairness dashboard"** showing reward distribution and usage rates
