"""Sprint 476 — incident-response lifecycle invariant pins.

Live-verified 2026-05-16 against running daemon. Full lifecycle:
open → event → advance → recommendations → comms-template →
playbook decision tree.

The load-bearing invariants:
  1. Timeline accumulates events (never overwrites)
  2. Advance transitions phase + appends to timeline
  3. Recommendations key on (severity, current_phase)
  4. Playbook decision tree contains the Vision §14
     emergency-response guidance
