# Marketplace Component Status

## Overview
The PRSM marketplace system is currently in a transitional development state. Core components exist but are intentionally disabled in production to prevent exposure of mock implementations.

## Current Status

### ✅ Active Components
- **Marketplace Launch API** (`/prsm/api/marketplace_launch_api.py`) - Functional controlled launch endpoint
- **Tool Marketplace** (`/prsm/marketplace/tool_marketplace.py`) - MCP tool marketplace (functional)
- **Model Marketplace MVP** (`/prsm/marketplace/model_marketplace.py`) - Basic model operations
- **Expanded Marketplace Service** (`/prsm/marketplace/expanded_marketplace_service.py`) - Comprehensive service layer

### ❌ Disabled Components
- **Main Marketplace API** (`/prsm/api/marketplace_api.py`) - Commented out in `main.py` line 41
- **Core Marketplace Service Database Operations** - Contains mock implementations instead of real SQLAlchemy operations

### ⚠️ Components with TODOs
- **Expanded Marketplace Service** - Missing admin permissions, timing, and analytics implementations
- **Payment Processing** - Tokenomics marketplace needs real payment integration

## Why Components Are Disabled

The main marketplace API is intentionally disabled because:

1. **Mock Database Operations**: `marketplace_service.py` contains placeholder implementations:
   ```python
   # In a real implementation, this would use SQLAlchemy
   # Mock implementation - in reality, would query database
   ```

2. **Hardcoded Data**: Search results and statistics use mock data instead of real database queries

3. **Incomplete Payment Integration**: Real FTNS payment processing is not fully implemented

## Development Path Forward

### Phase 1: Database Integration (HIGH Priority)
- Replace mock implementations in `marketplace_service.py` with real SQLAlchemy operations
- Implement actual database schema for marketplace listings and transactions
- Add proper error handling and validation

### Phase 2: Payment Integration (HIGH Priority)  
- Complete FTNS payment processing integration
- Implement escrow and settlement mechanisms
- Add transaction monitoring and fraud detection

### Phase 3: API Enablement (MEDIUM Priority)
- Re-enable `marketplace_api.py` in `main.py` once database operations are real
- Add comprehensive API testing and validation
- Implement rate limiting and security measures

### Phase 4: Analytics and Admin Features (LOW Priority)
- Complete TODO items in expanded marketplace service
- Add admin dashboards and monitoring
- Implement advanced marketplace analytics

## External Audit Compliance

This documentation addresses the external audit finding: "duplicated and inactive files, such as a disabled marketplace"

**Resolution**: Marketplace components are intentionally disabled pending completion of real database implementations. This is a security best practice to prevent exposure of mock functionality in production.

**Next Steps**: Complete Phase 1 (Database Integration) before re-enabling marketplace APIs.
