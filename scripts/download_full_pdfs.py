"""
Batch PDF Download for Complete NWTN Corpus
===========================================

Downloads and processes full PDFs for all 149,726 papers in the corpus,
replacing abstract-only data with complete paper content.

Features:
- Concurrent downloading with rate limiting (respectful to arXiv)
- Automatic retry logic for failed downloads
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Full content extraction and structured storage
