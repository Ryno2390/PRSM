# PRSM Security Hardening Guide

## Overview

This guide provides security hardening recommendations and implementation guidelines for PRSM (Protocol for Recursive Scientific Modeling) deployments.

## Quick Reference

For the complete security hardening report and current security status, see:
- **[Security Hardening Report](../prsm/security/SECURITY_HARDENING_REPORT.md)** - Detailed security implementation status
- **[Security Framework](../security/README.md)** - Complete security audit system and procedures

## Security Hardening Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Set up JWT token rotation
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

### Network Security
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL encryption
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up VPN access for admin operations
- [ ] Implement network segmentation
- [ ] Configure DDoS protection

### Database Security
- [ ] Enable database encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure database access controls
- [ ] Set up database audit logging
- [ ] Implement backup encryption
- [ ] Configure connection pooling security

### Container Security
- [ ] Use minimal base images
- [ ] Scan containers for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Configure container security policies
- [ ] Implement runtime security monitoring
- [ ] Set up secure container registries

### Application Security
- [ ] Enable security middleware
- [ ] Configure input validation
- [ ] Set up security headers
- [ ] Implement CORS policies
- [ ] Configure secure logging

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Configure security alerts
- [ ] Implement log analysis
- [ ] Set up incident response procedures
- [ ] Configure compliance reporting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Production Deployment
For production deployment security hardening:

1. **Review Security Framework**: Start with the [Security Framework](../security/README.md)
2. **Check Current Status**: Review the [Security Hardening Report](../prsm/security/SECURITY_HARDENING_REPORT.md)
3. **Follow Operations Manual**: Use the [Production Operations Manual](PRODUCTION_OPERATIONS_MANUAL.md)
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up monitoring per [Performance Metrics](PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md)

### Development Environment
For development environment security:

1. **Use Secure Defaults**: Follow the [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. **Run Security Audits**: Use the automated security audit system
3. **Test Security Features**: Validate security implementations
4. **Review Code**: Follow secure coding practices

## Security Policies

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Session timeout policies

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data classification and handling
- Privacy by design principles
- GDPR compliance measures

### Incident Response
- Incident response procedures
- Security team contacts
- Escalation procedures
- Documentation requirements

## Compliance Framework

### Standards Alignment
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Service organization controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security framework alignment

### Audit Requirements
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability assessments
- Compliance reporting

## Security Tools

### Automated Security
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning
- Code security analysis
- Infrastructure security monitoring

### Manual Security
- Security code reviews
- Architecture security reviews
- Penetration testing
- Security assessments
