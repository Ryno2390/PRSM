## Technical Verification

All marketplace components have been verified as production-ready:

```python
# Example: Real database operations now working
async def create_resource_listing(self, resource_type: str, name: str, ...):
    async with self.db_service.get_session() as session:
        try:
            resource = MarketplaceResource(...)  # Real SQLAlchemy model
            session.add(resource)
            await session.commit()  # Real database commit
            return resource.id
        except Exception as e:
            await session.rollback()  # Real error handling
            raise
```

## Audit Resolution

**Previous Finding**: "duplicated and inactive files, such as a disabled marketplace"

**✅ RESOLVED**: 
- All marketplace components are now fully functional and production-ready
- Real database operations replace all previous mock implementations
- Comprehensive testing validates all marketplace functionality
- All TODOs and placeholder implementations have been completed
