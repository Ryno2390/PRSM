# Distilled Teacher Models in PRSM

PRSM relies on a layered system of modular, lightweight AIs. At the heart of its continuous improvement process lies the concept of **Distilled Teacher Models**—meta-models trained not to perform tasks directly, but to **improve other models**. These teacher AIs curate training tasks, evaluate learning progress, and guide the evolution of student models across the PRSM ecosystem.

## 🎓 What Are Distilled Teacher Models?

Distilled Teachers are specialized AIs trained to:

- Identify gaps in sub-model performance
- Generate effective training curricula (e.g. with RLVR)
- Supervise reinforcement learning tasks
- Provide minimal yet maximally useful feedback
- Adapt their pedagogy as students improve

Unlike traditional large “teacher” models used in standard distillation, PRSM's Distilled Teachers are:

- **Lightweight** and modular
- **Evolving** through self-refinement
- **Decentralized** and hostable by any user
- **Evaluated** based on their downstream student performance

## 🔁 Recursive Teacher Refinement

Distilled Teachers are themselves improved over time via a recursive pipeline:

1. **Student Performance Tracking**: Log learning gains across iterations.
2. **Teacher Attribution**: Record which teacher created the training sample.
3. **Reward Scoring**: Apply verifiable reward metrics (e.g. reduced loss, improved F1).
4. **RLVR Update Cycle**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards adjusts teacher weights.
5. **Teacher Distillation**: Top-performing teachers are distilled into lighter versions and propagated across the network.

## 🧪 Key Components

### 1. **Curriculum Generator**
- Samples training examples of increasing difficulty
- Dynamically adjusts complexity based on student model trajectory

### 2. **Error Analyzer**
- Clusters student mistakes into conceptual categories
- Identifies blind spots and tail distribution errors

### 3. **Reward Engine**
- Uses RLVR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
- Determines how useful each lesson was
- Reduces reliance on human feedback

### 4. **Meta-Teacher Optimizer**
- Selects which teaching strategies outperform others
- Promotes diversity across the teacher population
- Enables evolution of pedagogy itself

## 🛠️ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Manual Bootstrapping
- Use pre-trained LLMs (e.g. LLaMA 3, Claude, GPT-4) to simulate teacher behavior
- Human-evaluated training exercises seeded into the system

### Phase 2: Early Self-Supervised Teachers
- First-generation distilled teachers trained using RLVR
- Curriculum adapts as student models show measurable improvement

### Phase 3: Recursive Teacher Network
- Teacher models evolve into specialized roles (e.g. math tutor, optimizer, debugger)
- Distilled recursively from previous generations
- Public performance leaderboards drive open-source competition

## 💎 Incentives for Teacher Development

| Contribution | FTNS Earned |
|--------------|-------------|
| Distilling a new teacher model | 🪙 Based on downstream student performance |
| Hosting a widely used teacher | 🪙 Based on frequency of training calls |
| Improving a poor-performing student via targeted training | 🪙 Proportional to loss delta |
| Publishing reusable curriculum sets | 🪙 Based on reuse frequency |

Teachers are a first-class token-earning component in PRSM’s economy.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Learning Gain**: Improvement in test loss/accuracy before and after training
- **Curriculum Efficiency**: Number of examples required to reach milestone
- **Transferability**: Can the curriculum help models from other domains?
- **Robustness**: Does the student generalize better after teaching?

All metrics are tracked and publicly logged in the decentralized ledger for transparency.

## 🧠 Example Use Case: Absolute Zero

PRSM integrates methodologies like **Absolute Zero**, a reinforcement learning technique that:

- Focuses on sparse but high-quality examples
- Removes human labels in favor of in-model verification
- Encourages models to explore the limits of their understanding

Distilled Teachers based on Absolute Zero can create thought-provoking, model-validatable prompts, ideal for self-refinement at scale.

## 🔐 Safety and Alignment

Distilled Teachers enhance PRSM’s alignment guarantees by:

- Encouraging narrow, safe specialization
- Allowing community audits of training material
- Preventing large generalist models from dictating behavior
- Incorporating circuit-breaker governance to remove bad actors

Each teacher model can be voted in/out based on transparent performance logs.

## 🔄 Federation of Teaching Agents

Teachers are shared across the PRSM ecosystem via:

- IPFS fingerprinting and versioning
- Public performance ratings
- Optional forking and local fine-tuning
- Integration into marketplace routing systems for model training

## 📌 Summary

Distilled Teacher Models are the pedagogical backbone of PRSM. They enable continuous, decentralized model improvement through a scalable, token-incentivized, and self-refining architecture. As PRSM grows, so too does its teacher network—becoming smarter, faster, and more aligned with the evolving needs of its global research community.
