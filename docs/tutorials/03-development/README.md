# Development Path

Welcome to the PRSM Development Path! This path is designed for developers who want to build sophisticated AI applications using PRSM's distributed intelligence capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

- **Advanced API Usage**: Complex queries, batch processing, and optimization
- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI models for complex tasks
- **Cost Optimization**: Implementing intelligent cost management strategies
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing applications for speed and efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Building robust, fault-tolerant AI applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this path, you should have completed:
- [Quick Start](../01-quick-start/) - Basic PRSM setup and usage
- [Foundation](../02-foundation/) - Core concepts and API fundamentals

## Development Path Modules

### 1. Advanced API Patterns
- Complex query composition
- Batch processing strategies
- Streaming implementations
- Caching patterns

### 2. Multi-Model Applications
- Model selection strategies
- Ensemble techniques
- Fallback mechanisms
- Performance comparison

### 3. Cost-Optimized Development
- Budget management
- Cost monitoring
- Optimization algorithms
- ROI measurement

### 4. Production-Ready Applications
- Error handling patterns
- Monitoring and logging
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

### 5. Integration Patterns
- Framework integrations
- Database connectivity
- External API coordination
- Workflow orchestration

## Hands-On Projects

### Project 1: Intelligent Document Processor
Build a document processing system that:
- Analyzes documents with multiple models
- Optimizes for cost and accuracy
- Handles various document formats
- Provides real-time progress tracking

### Project 2: AI-Powered Customer Service
Create a customer service system featuring:
- Intent classification
- Response generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Escalation logic

### Project 3: Content Generation Pipeline
Develop a content pipeline that:
- Generates multiple content types
- Maintains quality standards
- Optimizes generation costs
- Supports collaborative editing

## Development Tools

### PRSM CLI
Use the PRSM CLI for development workflows:
```bash
# Initialize new project
prsm init my-ai-app

# Generate boilerplate code
prsm generate api-client

# Run development server
prsm dev --watch

# Test and validate
prsm test --coverage
```

### Development Environment
Set up your development environment:
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install prsm-sdk[dev]

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Configure development settings
export PRSM_ENVIRONMENT=development
export PRSM_DEBUG=true
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Separate concerns (models, routing, processing)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow SOLID principles

### Performance Guidelines
- Implement intelligent caching
- Use async/await patterns
- Batch similar requests
- Monitor resource usage

### Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secure authentication
- Log security events
