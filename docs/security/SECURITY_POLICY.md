## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

#### Option 1: Email (Preferred)

Send an email to: **security@prsm-network.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept code
- Your contact information

#### Option 2: PGP Encrypted Email

For sensitive reports, use PGP encryption:

**PGP Key ID:** `0xPRSMSEC2025`  
**Fingerprint:** `Available at https://prsm-network.com/security/pgp`

#### Option 3: Security Portal

Submit via our security portal: **https://prsm-network.com/security/report**

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
3. **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
4. **Resolution Timeline**: Based on severity

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **P0 Critical** | Active exploitation, data breach risk | 24 hours |
| **P1 High** | Significant vulnerability, no active exploit | 7 days |
| **P2 Medium** | Limited impact, requires specific conditions | 30 days |
| **P3 Low** | Minor issue, hard to exploit | 90 days |

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we've had a chance to fix it
2. **Do not** access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you
3. **Do not** perform actions that could harm system availability
4. **Do** provide us reasonable time to fix the issue before disclosure
5. **Do** report vulnerabilities in good faith

### Bug Bounty Program

We offer rewards for valid security reports:

| Severity | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| P0 Critical | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| P1 High | $1,000 - $5,000 |
| P2 Medium | $500 - $1,000 |
| P3 Low | $100 - $500 |

*Rewards are subject to our bug bounty program terms and conditions.*

## Security Response Process

### Incident Response Phases

#### Phase 1: Identification (0-2 hours)

1. Receive vulnerability report
2. Acknowledge receipt
3. Assign severity level
4. Assign incident lead

#### Phase 2: Containment (2-24 hours)

1. Assess scope and impact
2. Implement temporary mitigations
3. Preserve evidence
4. Notify affected parties

#### Phase 3: Remediation (24-72 hours)

1. Develop fix
2. Test fix thoroughly
3. Deploy fix to staging
4. Validate fix effectiveness

#### Phase 4: Recovery (72-96 hours)

1. Deploy fix to production
2. Monitor for issues
3. Update documentation
4. Communicate resolution

#### Phase 5: Post-Incident (1-2 weeks)

1. Conduct post-mortem
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update security measures
4. Share findings (where appropriate)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use allowlist validation where possible
   - Sanitize outputs for context

2. **Authentication**
   - Never store passwords in plaintext
   - Use strong hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
   - Implement proper session management

3. **Authorization**
   - Check permissions on every request
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Use role-based access control

4. **Cryptography**
   - Use established libraries
   - Never roll your own crypto
   - Keep keys secure and rotate regularly

5. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose internal details
   - Log errors securely
   - Use generic error messages for users

#### Secure Development

```python
# Good: Parameterized queries
from sqlalchemy import text

query = text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id")
result = db.execute(query, {"id": user_id})

# Bad: String concatenation
# query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # Never do this!
```

```python
# Good: Input validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class UserInput(BaseModel):
    username: str
    
    @validator('username')
    def validate_username(cls, v):
        if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$', v):
            raise ValueError('Invalid username format')
        return v
```

### For Operators

#### Infrastructure Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Use SSH keys, not passwords
   - Implement MFA for admin access
   - Use principle of least privilege

2. **Network Security**
   - Enable firewall rules
   - Use VPN for internal access
   - Implement network segmentation

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerting for anomalies
   - Regular security audits

4. **Updates**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Automate dependency updates
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities

#### Secrets Management

```bash
# Good: Use secrets manager
export SECRETS_BACKEND=vault
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.example.com

# Bad: Hardcode secrets
# export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host/db"  # Never do this!
```

### For Users

#### Account Security

1. **Strong Passwords**
   - Use at least 16 characters
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters
   - Use a password manager

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Enable MFA on your account
   - Use authenticator app (not SMS if possible)
   - Keep backup codes secure

3. **Session Management**
   - Log out when done
   - Don't share sessions
   - Monitor active sessions
