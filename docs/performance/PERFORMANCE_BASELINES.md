# PRSM Performance Baselines & Monitoring Guide
**Production-Ready Performance Standards and SLA Framework**

## Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive performance baselines for the PRSM (Production-Ready Semantic Marketplace) system, defining critical operation benchmarks for production deployment, SLA monitoring, and performance regression detection. These baselines serve as the foundation for Series A production readiness validation and ongoing performance management.

## Performance Baseline Framework

### Baseline Methodology

Our performance baseline establishment follows industry best practices:

1. **Multi-Metric Assessment:** Each component evaluated across multiple performance dimensions
2. **Percentile-Based Targets:** P50, P95, and P99 thresholds for comprehensive coverage
3. **SLA Alignment:** Performance targets aligned with business SLA requirements
4. **Production Conditions:** Baselines established under realistic production load scenarios
5. **Continuous Validation:** Automated monitoring and regression detection

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Component | Critical Metrics | Business Impact |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **API Layer** | Response Time, Throughput | User Experience |
| **Database** | Query Time, Connection Pool | Data Access Speed |
| **Cache** | Hit Ratio, Response Time | System Efficiency |
| **FTNS** | Transaction Time, Throughput | Business Operations |
| **Marketplace** | Search Time, Relevance | Core Functionality |
| **System** | CPU/Memory Usage | Infrastructure Health |
