NWTN (Newton) - Neural Web for Transformation Networking
Hybrid AI Architecture Implementation for PRSM

This module implements the complete hybrid AI architecture described in the
brainstorming document, featuring:

System 1 (Fast/Intuitive):
- Transformer-based pattern recognition
- Rapid SOC (Subject/Object/Concept) identification
- Multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)

System 2 (Slow/Logical):
- First-principles world model reasoning
- Causal relationship validation
- Logical consistency checking

Learning & Collaboration:
- Bayesian search with automated experimentation
- Knowledge sharing across PRSM network
- Hive mind updates for core knowledge
- Threshold-based SOC confidence management

Key Components:
- HybridNWTNEngine: Main hybrid reasoning engine
- WorldModelEngine: First-principles reasoning system
- BayesianSearchEngine: Automated experimentation
- HybridNWTNManager: Multi-agent coordination

Usage:
    from prsm.nwtn import create_hybrid_agent, create_agent_team
    
    # Single agent
    agent = await create_hybrid_agent(domain="physics")
    result = await agent.process_query("What is energy conservation?")
    
    # Agent team
    team = await create_agent_team("chemistry", team_size=3)
    result = await process_team_query(team, "How do catalysts work?")
