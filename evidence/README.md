# PRSM Automated Evidence Generation

This directory contains **automatically generated evidence reports** that provide real-time validation of PRSM's technical capabilities and investment readiness.

## 🎯 Purpose

The automated evidence pipeline addresses Gemini's key recommendation: **"Fully Automated Evidence Pipeline"** that ensures transparent, verifiable validation data is generated on every commit.

## 📊 What Gets Generated

Every time code is pushed to the main branch, the system automatically:

1. **Runs comprehensive tests** across all PRSM components
2. **Collects real performance data** from RLT system integration
3. **Generates security reports** with current vulnerability status  
4. **Validates real-world scenarios** with actual API integration
5. **Creates investment-ready reports** with confidence scoring

## 🔍 Evidence Quality Standards

Each report clearly distinguishes between:
- ✅ **Real System Data** - Actual performance from running components
- ⚠️ **Historical Data** - Previous test results and benchmarks  
- 📊 **Estimated Data** - Projections based on system characteristics

## 🤖 Automation Features

- **Triggered on every commit** to main branch
- **Automatically committed back** to repository for transparency
- **Timestamped archives** for historical comparison
- **Investment-grade formatting** for stakeholder review
- **Zero manual intervention** required

## 📈 Investment Transparency

This automated pipeline provides:
- **Real-time investment scoring** (0-100 scale)
- **Technical validation evidence** for due diligence
- **Performance trend tracking** across development cycles
- **Security compliance monitoring** with automatic updates

## 🔗 Integration

The evidence generation is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline as part of the quality gate assessment. Reports are generated after all tests pass but before deployment decisions.
