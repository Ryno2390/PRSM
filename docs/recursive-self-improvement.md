# Recursive Self-Improvement in PRSM

PRSM (Protocol for Recursive Scientific Modeling) is designed not only to orchestrate decentralized scientific AI workflows, but to continuously evolve and enhance its capabilities through **Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)**.

This document outlines how RSI is integrated into PRSM as both an architectural pattern and an operational principle.

## ♻️ What is Recursive Self-Improvement?

Recursive Self-Improvement refers to the process by which an intelligent system:

1. Monitors its own performance
2. Identifies areas of weakness or inefficiency
3. Generates targeted improvements to its own architecture, models, or training data
4. Validates those improvements
5. Incorporates validated improvements into future versions

PRSM implements RSI in a decentralized, transparent, and safety-aware manner.

## 🧠 The Role of Distilled Teacher Models

Distilled Teacher Models are specialized AIs that oversee the training of sub-models. These teachers:

- Develop and evolve domain-specific curricula
- Monitor student model performance
- Adapt their teaching strategies over time
- Are themselves subject to evolutionary refinement

PRSM treats **teacher models as first-class citizens in the RSI loop**, optimizing them for their ability to improve others.

## 🔁 The RSI Feedback Loop

PRSM embeds the following recursive loop into its operation:

1. **Observation**:
   - Every model interaction is logged and scored
   - Task outcomes are tied to model performance and input quality

2. **Assessment**:
   - Metrics like error rates, refutation frequency, token usage efficiency, and reasoning traceability are analyzed
   - Models with deteriorating performance are flagged

3. **Refinement Proposal**:
   - Models propose architecture tweaks, prompt engineering improvements, or training data augmentations
   - Competing proposals are submitted and benchmarked

4. **Evolutionary Selection**:
   - A/B testing and tournament-style evaluations determine the most successful refinements
   - Winning improvements are rewarded with FTNS and merged into the next generation

5. **Propagation**:
   - Improvements are distributed across the network
   - Node operators and contributors are notified and incentivized to update

## 🔍 Specialized Roles in the RSI System

- **Teacher Distillers**: Create better curricula and learning pathways for new models
- **Meta-Prompters**: Tune prompts for enhanced alignment and performance
- **Performance Auditors**: Evaluate effectiveness across tasks and domains
- **Architect AIs**: Propose structural refactorings to the task decomposition hierarchy
- **Router Trainers**: Optimize matching logic between tasks and models

## 🔐 Safety Constraints on RSI

To prevent runaway or unsafe self-modification, PRSM applies the following constraints:

- **Sandboxed Testing**: All changes are trialed in isolated environments before propagation
- **Multisig Governance**: Critical architecture changes require approval from multiple stakeholders
- **Rollback Capability**: Any deployed update can be rolled back via collective vote
- **Red Teaming**: Independent reviewers test for adversarial behavior and misalignment

---

## 🧠 Self-Improvement Without Centralization

PRSM implements RSI across a decentralized network using:

- IPFS-based storage for version tracking and provenance
- IOTA-style DAGs for logging improvement events
- Distributed consensus for update approval
- Public benchmarks and simulations for validation

Each improvement is traceable, reproducible, and auditable.

## 📈 Incentives for Continuous Improvement

PRSM rewards contributors to the RSI process through:

| Contribution Type | FTNS Earned Based On |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Improved distilled models | Performance uplift over baseline |
| New teacher architectures | Student model gains |
| Refined prompts or task flows | Reduced execution cost |
| Safety interventions | Prevention of failure modes |
| Curriculum design | Model generalizability improvements |

This creates a market for innovation where contributors compete to improve the system itself.

## 🧬 The Long-Term Vision

RSI ensures that PRSM:

- Remains relevant as scientific domains evolve
- Gets faster, safer, and more efficient over time
- Improves with use—like a collective brain growing stronger with each interaction
- Enables a co-evolution of humans and machines toward higher-order discovery
