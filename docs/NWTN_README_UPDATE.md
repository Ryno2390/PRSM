*Generic, stilted, no specific insights, template-driven*

#### **AFTER: Context-Rich Sophisticated Synthesis**
```
"The analysis reveals a fascinating convergence between three different 
reasoning approaches that illuminates how analogical reasoning can 
accelerate AI breakthroughs. The analogical engine identified striking 
parallels between biological neural development and artificial network 
training (confidence: 0.87), discovering that synaptic pruning mechanisms 
mirror attention head specialization in transformers. Meanwhile, the 
causal analysis uncovered specific mechanisms where evolutionary pressure 
dynamics directly map to gradient descent optimization landscapes...

The cross-engine synthesis reveals a breakthrough opportunity: just as 
biological systems use analogical transfer between sensory modalities 
(visual-to-auditory processing), AI systems could leverage cross-domain 
knowledge transfer between reasoning modes. The probabilistic assessment 
suggests a 76% likelihood that implementing this analogical framework 
could accelerate breakthrough discovery by 3-4x..."
