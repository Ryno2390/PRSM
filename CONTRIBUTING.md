async def test_prompt_optimization():
    optimizer = PromptOptimizer()
    result = await optimizer.optimize_for_domain("test prompt", "science")
    assert result is not None
    assert len(result) > 0

# Integration tests for component interactions
async def test_agent_pipeline():
    # Test the full prompter -> router -> compiler pipeline
