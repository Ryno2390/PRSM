## Testing Approach

### 1. Multi-Layered Integration Testing

We implemented a comprehensive testing strategy with three complementary approaches:

#### Mock-Based Integration Testing (`test_system_integration.py`)
- **Purpose**: Validate integration patterns without requiring production infrastructure
- **Scope**: Complete PRSM workflow (7 phases), marketplace (9 resource types), budget management
- **Result**: 100% success rate (20/20 tests passed)
- **Benefits**: Fast execution, reliable results, comprehensive coverage

#### Actual Component Testing (`test_actual_prsm_integration.py`) 
- **Purpose**: Test real PRSM component imports with graceful fallbacks
- **Scope**: Component availability, import resolution, cross-component integration
- **Result**: Identified dependency issues and provided specific recommendations
- **Benefits**: Real-world validation, dependency mapping, issue identification

#### Focused Integration Testing
- **Budget Integration** (`test_budget_integration.py`): 100% success rate
- **System Health Monitoring** (`test_system_health.py`): 65.3% overall health score

### 2. Proof-of-Concept Validation Strategy

The testing approach was specifically designed for PRSM's current proof-of-concept phase:
- **Graceful degradation** for missing production services
- **Mock services** for external dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, IPFS)
- **Component isolation** testing to identify integration boundaries
- **Performance baselines** establishment for future optimization

## Integration Issues Identified & Workarounds

### 1. Import Dependency Chain Issues

**Issue**: Complex dependency chains cause import failures when external services aren't available.

**Root Cause**: 
```python
# Example problematic import chain:
from prsm.tokenomics.ftns_budget_manager import FTNSBudgetManager
  └─ from ..marketplace.ftns_marketplace import FTNSMarketplace  
      └─ from ..integrations.security.audit_logger import audit_logger
          └─ from .enhanced_sandbox import EnhancedSandboxManager
              └─ asyncio.create_task() # Requires running event loop
```

**Workaround Implemented**: 
- Added `get_database_service()` function to `/prsm/core/database.py`
- Created fallback models in integration tests
- Implemented graceful import handling with try/catch blocks

**Production Solution**: 
- Implement lazy loading for optional dependencies
- Add dependency injection for external services
- Create service registry for component discovery

### 2. Event Loop Initialization Issues

**Issue**: Some components try to create asyncio tasks during import, causing "no running event loop" errors.

**Workaround**: Modified integration tests to handle import errors gracefully.

**Production Solution**: 
- Move async task creation to component initialization methods
- Implement proper async context management
- Add service startup/shutdown lifecycle management

### 3. External Service Dependencies

**Issue**: Production services (PostgreSQL, Redis, IPFS) not available in development environment.

**Workaround**: 
- Mock services for integration testing
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Clear documentation of production requirements

**Production Solution**:
- Docker Compose setup for local development
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Service discovery and health checking

## Integration Test Framework Architecture

### Mock Service Infrastructure

```python
# Comprehensive mock services for testing
