# PRSM Safety Architecture

PRSM is designed with safety and alignment at the core of its architecture. In a world where powerful AI systems can be misused or misaligned, PRSM offers a federated, transparent, and decentralized alternative to traditional centralized AI systems.

## 🔒 Why Safety Matters

Most advanced AI models today are:

- Trained behind closed doors
- Controlled by a small number of actors
- Capable of performing general tasks with limited oversight
- Vulnerable to abuse, model collapse, or unintended emergent behavior

PRSM flips this model on its head by design.

---

## 🧱 Safety Through Modularity

Rather than deploying one massive, general-purpose AGI, PRSM decomposes intelligence into:

- Specialized, task-specific sub-models
- Controlled data scopes
- Limited interfaces for execution

This "fractured" approach limits single-point failure and reduces the risk of broad, unchecked generalization.

---

## 🌀 Recursive Task Decomposition

PRSM uses recursive refraction of complex prompts into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is:

- Limited in scope and input/output
- Routed to the most relevant, distilled model
- Audited independently before recombination

This makes it nearly impossible for a single malicious subtask to produce large-scale harm.

---

## 📡 Torrent-Like Federation with Circuit Breakers

All AI components in PRSM are distributed across user devices using a torrent-inspired protocol. Each participant:

- Hosts small shards of models or data
- Can cut off connections ("trip a circuit breaker") if a safety concern is detected
- Votes on updates to models via a consensus system

> Any node can halt execution if something seems "off"—like a Toyota factory worker stopping the line.

## 🔁 Teacher Distillation with Verifiable Rewards

PRSM uses a unique training methodology:

- Distilled "teacher" models guide sub-AIs via specialized curricula
- Curricula are scored via RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards)
- Teachers that produce aligned students are rewarded with FTNS

This creates decentralized, bottom-up model alignment without relying on a central authority.

---

## 🔍 Provenance Tracking via IPFS

All information ingested into PRSM is tracked via cryptographic content hashes:

- Verifies where data came from
- Allows participants to "blacklist" or downrank harmful sources
- Supports royalty payments tied to usage frequency

Transparent origins make it easier to trace and respond to misuse.

---

## 🗳️ Open Governance & Contention Protocols

- Any decision (e.g., flagging misuse, modifying system logic) goes through open, term-based votes
- Users can flag AGI outputs they believe are unsafe or incorrect
- "Contention credits" allow users to challenge judgments, triggering human or multisig review

This ensures no single user or node dominates the system's ethical decisions.

---

## 🧩 Functional Limitations of Sub-AIs

Most PRSM models are:

- Small, distilled, and purpose-built
- Lacking broad general capabilities
- Focused on tight domains (e.g., modeling catalysts, simulating energy flows)

Their usefulness comes from orchestration, not individual capability—limiting the impact of any rogue model.

---

## 🧬 Evolutionary Pressure for Alignment

Because sub-models are evaluated based on:

- Their performance
- Their composability with other models
- Their trustworthiness

…aligned models naturally outperform misaligned ones.

> In PRSM, safety is a competitive advantage—not a constraint.

---

## 🧯 Built-In Redundancy & Refutation Layers

For every output, PRSM records:

- The reasoning path
- All supporting subtasks and results
- Confidence scores from each model

Users can audit any decision, trace errors, or propose better alternatives.

## 🔒 Privacy-Preserving Safety Infrastructure

PRSM's safety architecture includes comprehensive privacy protection to ensure researchers can participate safely:

### **Anonymous Safety Reporting**
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Secure, anonymous channels for reporting safety concerns without fear of retaliation
- **Anonymous Flagging**: Report unsafe outputs or models without revealing identity
- **Private Contention**: Challenge decisions through encrypted, anonymous contention protocols

### **Privacy-Preserving Audits**
- **Zero-Knowledge Safety Verification**: Prove models meet safety standards without revealing implementation details
- **Anonymous Model Validation**: Verify model behavior without exposing proprietary algorithms or training data
- **Private Governance Participation**: Vote on safety measures and policies while maintaining anonymity

### **Censorship-Resistant Safety Mechanisms**
- **Decentralized Circuit Breakers**: Distributed safety halt mechanisms resistant to single-point censorship
- **Anonymous Network Propagation**: Safety alerts distributed through Tor/I2P networks
- **Jurisdiction-Diverse Infrastructure**: Safety monitoring across multiple legal jurisdictions

### **Protected Research Domains**
- **Sensitive Topic Research**: Enable research on politically sensitive or controversial topics with full anonymity
- **Authoritarian Regime Protection**: Researchers in restrictive countries can participate safely in safety governance
- **IP-Protected Safety Collaboration**: Companies can contribute to safety research without revealing trade secrets

## 🧭 Summary: Safety by Architecture

PRSM does not rely on "alignment patches" bolted onto centralized systems. Instead, it uses:

- Modular design
- Recursive task flow
- Torrent-based federation
- Verifiable training incentives
- Provenance tracking
- Contention and governance frameworks
- **Privacy-preserving safety mechanisms**
- **Anonymous participation and reporting**
- **Censorship-resistant infrastructure**

…to create a system where misaligned models can't thrive, and the community governs its own tools safely and anonymously.

PRSM is aligned not because it's watched—but because its structure makes alignment the path of least resistance, while protecting participants' privacy and enabling global, uncensored collaboration through comprehensive anonymity infrastructure.
