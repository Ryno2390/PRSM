Breakthrough Causal Reasoning Engine for NWTN
=============================================

This module implements the Enhanced Causal Engine from the NWTN Novel Idea Generation Roadmap Phase 5.4.
It transforms traditional cause-effect identification into **Inverse Causation Discovery** for breakthrough intervention design.

Architecture:
- HiddenCausationDiscoverer: Identifies delayed, emergent, and bridged causation patterns
- CausalInterventionDesigner: Designs novel interventions for breakthrough outcomes
- InverseCausationAnalyzer: Works backward from desired outcomes to identify intervention points

Based on NWTN Roadmap Phase 5.4 - Enhanced Causal Reasoning Engine (High Priority)
Expected Impact: Design novel interventions for desired breakthroughs
