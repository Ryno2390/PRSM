    B --> C[Efficiency Becomes Key]
    C --> D[PRSM Advantage]
    
    E[Competitors: More Compute] --> F[Energy/Hardware Limits]
    F --> G[Unsustainable Economics]
    
    H[PRSM: Smarter Compute] --> I[Distributed Optimization]
    I --> J[Sustainable Advantage]
```

**Competitive Moat**: As scaling costs exponentially increase, efficiency optimization becomes the only sustainable path forward.
