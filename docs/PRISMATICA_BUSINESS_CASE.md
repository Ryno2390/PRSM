## The Prismatica-PRSM Innovation Engine

### Revolutionary Two-Tiered Architecture

**PRSM Foundation (Non-Profit Layer)**
- Global decentralized AI research network
- Incentivizes novel data, model contributions, edge compute
- Democratic governance through FTNS token system
- Output: cutting-edge models, datasets, research insights

**Prismatica Holdings (Commercial Layer)**

### The Recursive Intelligence-Fabrication Flywheel

```
PRSM Decentralized Research → Bayesian APM Discovery Engine → 
Recursive Experimentation → Self-Improving Fabrication Tools → 
Atomically Precise Products → Commercial Success → Reinvestment → 
Enhanced PRSM Ecosystem → Accelerated Recursive Intelligence
```

**Core Innovation**: Convergence of recursive intelligence (PRSM + Bayesian search) with recursive fabrication (Feynman trees), creating a "recursive engine of recursive engines" that builds the substrate for generalized APM acceleration.

**Philosophical Foundation**: This approach integrates K. Eric Drexler's systems engineering vision from *Radical Abundance* with Richard Feynman's 1959 lecture *"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"* - machines building smaller machines recursively. Prismatica sees this convergence as the most credible roadmap toward developing civilization-scale capability for molecular-level engineering.

**The Strategic Question**: *"The question is not what can be built. The question is what can build what builds what can be built."* - Prismatica focuses on building the builders that build the builders.
