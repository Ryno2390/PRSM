Integration Tests for Hybrid Architecture
Demonstrates hybrid architecture superiority over traditional LLM approaches

These tests validate the complete integration of the hybrid architecture
with PRSM's routing system, showing automatic detection and superior
performance on chemistry-related tasks.

Test Coverage:
1. Automatic chemistry task detection
2. Router selection of hybrid executor
3. Hybrid executor performance vs LLM baseline
4. End-to-end integration validation
5. Performance benchmarking

Usage:
