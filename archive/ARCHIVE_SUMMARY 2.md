## ‚ôªÔ∏è Archive Policy

This archive preserves institutional knowledge while maintaining a clean, focused repository structure. Files are archived when:
- All planned work has been completed and integrated
- Planning documents become outdated due to accelerated progress
- Historical assessments are superseded by actual implementation
- Repository organization benefits from decluttering completed work

All archived files remain accessible for historical context and lessons learned documentation.
