*Addressing Critical Concerns with Engineering Rigor*

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap addresses the key concerns raised in the technical due diligence report through a focused 90-day sprint targeting risk reduction, technical validation, and ecosystem readiness. Priority is given to demonstrable results that validate our core assumptions about distributed AI orchestration.

**Primary Goals:**

## Key Concerns Identified

### 🚩 Critical (Red Flags)
1. **Unproven Network Effects** - Complex coordination never achieved at scale
2. **Missing Performance Benchmarks** - No evidence of advantages over centralized systems
3. **Bootstrap Paradox** - Requires simultaneous critical mass across stakeholders
4. **Technical Complexity vs UX** - Too complex for mainstream adoption
5. **Unvalidated Safety Mechanisms** - Distributed safety unproven under adversarial conditions

### ⚠️ High Priority (Yellow Flags) 
1. **Tokenomics Complexity** - Economic incentives may not align under stress
2. **Heavy External Dependencies** - IPFS, blockchain, consensus systems
3. **Quality Assurance at Scale** - No mechanism to prevent degraded models
4. **Distributed Latency Overhead** - Multi-stage orchestration performance penalty
