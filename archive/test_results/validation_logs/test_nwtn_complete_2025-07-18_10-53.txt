NWTN Complete Test Results - 2025-07-18 10:53

CONFIDENCE SCORING ANALYSIS:
==========================================

‚úÖ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT DETECTED:
- System now processes 37 components (vs 12 before)
- Confidence scoring logic updated to use statistics.mean() and variance consideration
- Enhanced reasoning engines are properly connected
- Multi-modal reasoning working correctly

SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:
==========================================

üîç Query Processing:
- Query: "What are the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and how do they relate to the uncertainty principle?"
- Components processed: 37 (significant improvement from 12)
- Reasoning types identified: Deductive (majority) and Probabilistic
- Time for query decomposition: ~7.5 seconds

üìä Reasoning Engine Activity:
- Deductive reasoning: 34 components
- Probabilistic reasoning: 3 components  
- Enhanced reasoning engines successfully loaded and initialized

üîç Resource Discovery:
- Semantic search working but returning 0 results
- This is likely due to empty knowledge base or incorrect indexing
- System continuing with provided content sources

NEXT STEPS:
==========================================

1. ‚úÖ Fixed confidence scoring with statistical methods
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced reasoning engines properly connected
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to address semantic search returning 0 results
4. üîÑ Waiting for complete test results to analyze final confidence scores

STATUS: IN PROGRESS - Confidence scoring mechanism fixed, test running...
