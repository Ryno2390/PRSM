## 🌈 Newton's Light Spectrum Architecture

PRSM's seven-phase architecture follows Newton's discovery of light refraction, where **white light reveals its true spectrum** when passed through a prism:

- **🔬 NWTN** (Isaac Newton) → The pioneering scientist who first scientifically studied light refraction
- **🌈 PRSM** (Prism) → The medium that refracts "white light" intelligence into its component spectrum
- **⚡ FTNS** (Photons) → The fundamental particles of light and computational intelligence
- **🎨 ROY G BIV** → Seven phases following the natural progression of the visible light spectrum

**Architectural Metaphor**: Raw computational intelligence (white light) enters PRSM and is systematically refracted into seven distinct, specialized capabilities (the color spectrum). Each phase operates at its own "wavelength" and "frequency" while remaining fundamentally part of the same unified intelligence phenomenon.

This creates a **recursive scientific modeling** system where intelligence flows through each spectral phase, becoming increasingly specialized and powerful as it progresses from red (foundational) to violet (advanced marketplace systems).

---

## 🔧 Core Architectural Concepts

- **Recursive Decomposition ("Refraction")**: Complex user prompts are broken into successively smaller subtasks by a hierarchy of Architect AIs.
- **Parallel Execution**: Elemental tasks are processed simultaneously using a distributed network of lightweight, purpose-built models.
- **Decentralized Coordination**: All compute, data routing, and governance occur through decentralized infrastructure and peer-contributed resources.
- **Token-Gated Access**: PRSM’s core AGI, NWTN, consumes FTNS tokens to grant contextual reasoning and compute allocation.

## 🔄 Knowledge Diffing & Epistemic Alignment System

PRSM implements a sophisticated **diffing protocol** to prevent knowledge base divergence from the broader world and maintain epistemic accuracy as the system matures.

### **The Divergence Challenge**

As PRSM becomes a dominant research platform, it faces critical risks:
- **Closed-Loop Drift**: Internal models trained on previously generated outputs without fresh external input
- **Information Blind Spots**: Missing emerging insights from outside PRSM's ecosystem
- **Epistemic Isolation**: Gradual drift from scientific consensus due to insular feedback loops

### **Automated Diffing Protocol**

NWTN orchestrates periodic comparison cycles between PRSM's knowledge base and external sources:

  - Running pre/post-processing on edge devices
  - Distilling or improving sub-models

## 📌 Summary

PRSM replaces centralized monolithic AI with a distributed, recursive, modular, and incentivized system. Its architecture is designed for scalability, resilience, scientific transparency, and continuous improvement. By fragmenting large models into decentralized, purpose-built intelligences and connecting them with robust orchestration and incentive systems, PRSM offers a new paradigm for open AI.
