# PRSM REVISED 90-DAY ROADMAP: Solo Founder + AI Assistant Feasibility Analysis

**Document Type:** Revised Action Plan - Solo Founder Focus  
**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Revised by:** Technical Planning Assistant  
**Context:** Single founder with Claude/ChatGPT support, limited budget, development-stage focus

---

## ROADMAP RESTRUCTURE OVERVIEW

The original 90-day plan has been split into **two distinct execution tracks**:

- **Part 1: Solo Feasible Tasks (30-45 days)** - What one founder + AI can accomplish
- **Part 2: Outstanding Collaborative Tasks** - What requires team expansion or funding

This revision maintains the original technical vision while creating a realistic execution path for a solo founder working with AI assistants.
