Chemistry Reasoning Benchmark Suite
Comprehensive benchmarking for hybrid architecture vs traditional LLM approaches

This implements the benchmarking framework described in the Hybrid Architecture Roadmap
Phase 1, Week 5-6. It demonstrates the hybrid executor's superiority in chemical reasoning
by comparing against GPT-4 baseline on:

1. Reaction feasibility prediction
2. Product formation prediction  
3. Mechanism pathway analysis
4. Thermodynamic property estimation
5. Catalysis understanding

Key Features:
- Standardized test reactions from chemical databases
- Quantitative accuracy metrics
- Reasoning trace evaluation
- Compute efficiency measurements
- Learning adaptation tests

Usage:
    python -m prsm.evaluation.chemistry_benchmark
