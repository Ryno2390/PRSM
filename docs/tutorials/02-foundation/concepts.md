## üß† The Three Pillars of PRSM

### 1. NWTN (Newton) - AI Orchestrator

NWTN is PRSM's central intelligence that coordinates AI models to solve complex problems.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex problems into manageable tasks
- **Model Selection**: Chooses optimal AI models for each task
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and reasoning
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates and combines responses

**Simple Example:**
```python
# NWTN coordinates this complex query:
query = "Design a sustainable water purification system for rural communities"

# NWTN breaks it down:
# 1. Research existing purification methods
# 2. Analyze rural infrastructure constraints  
# 3. Evaluate sustainability criteria
# 4. Design system architecture
# 5. Calculate implementation costs
```

### 2. FTNS (Fungible Tokens for Node Support) - Economic Engine

FTNS tokens provide economic incentives for quality AI responses and network participation.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Token Economics**: Pay for AI processing with FTNS
- **Quality Incentives**: Better responses earn more tokens
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute computing fairly
- **Network Effects**: More participants = better performance

**Practical Example:**
```python
# You start with FTNS tokens
user_budget = 100  # FTNS tokens

# Each query costs tokens based on complexity
simple_query_cost = 5    # "What's the weather?"
complex_query_cost = 50  # "Analyze climate change impacts"

# Better models cost more but give better results
gpt4_cost = 25          # High-quality, expensive
gpt3_cost = 10          # Good quality, moderate cost
local_model_cost = 3    # Basic quality, very cheap
```

### 3. Teachers - Specialized AI Models

Teachers are AI models fine-tuned for specific domains and tasks.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Domain Specialization**: Expert knowledge in specific fields
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optimized for particular problem types  
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Compress large models efficiently
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve through feedback

**Teacher Types:**
```python
# Science Teachers
biology_teacher = "Specialized in biological processes"
chemistry_teacher = "Expert in molecular interactions"
physics_teacher = "Focused on physical phenomena"

# Creative Teachers  
writing_teacher = "Optimized for content creation"
art_teacher = "Specialized in visual concepts"
music_teacher = "Expert in musical theory"

# Technical Teachers
coding_teacher = "Focused on software development"
math_teacher = "Specialized in mathematical problem-solving"
data_teacher = "Expert in data analysis"
```

## üîÑ How They Work Together
