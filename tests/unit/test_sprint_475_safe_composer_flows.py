"""Sprint 475 — Foundation-Safe composer-flow invariant pins.

Live-verified 2026-05-16 against a running daemon. Two full
multi-step lifecycles operationally attested:

  Upgrade-proposal (POST /propose → GET /{id} → /update →
                    /compose-upgrade → /compose-rollback)
  Disclosure-payout (POST /submit → GET /{id} → /update →
                    /compose-payout → /record-payout-tx)

The **load-bearing Vision §14 invariant** both flows attest:
the composer PRODUCES the Safe-uploadable transaction; it does
NOT execute it. Foundation Safe 2-of-3 hardware multisig
retains exclusive privilege.

These pins defend:
  1. State-machine invariants (compose-rollback requires
     `status==executed`; compose-payout requires
     `status==AWARDED`)
  2. The composer "does not execute" language in the response
     warning + instructions text — operator-facing safety
     guidance that auditors verify
  3. Required Safe-tx fields (to, data, value, chain_id,
     warning, instructions)
