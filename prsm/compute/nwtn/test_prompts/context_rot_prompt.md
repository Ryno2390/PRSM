# Context Rot Prevention - NWTN Test Prompt

## Query

What are the most promising and innovative approaches for preventing context rot in large language models and AI systems? 

I'm particularly interested in breakthrough solutions that go beyond simple context window expansion. Please explore:

1. Novel architectural approaches that maintain long-term coherence
2. Dynamic memory systems that preserve essential information while discarding irrelevant details  
3. Hierarchical context management strategies
4. Real-time context compression and reconstruction techniques
5. Cross-domain approaches from cognitive science, neuroscience, or information theory
6. Hybrid human-AI collaboration methods for context preservation
7. Any paradigm-shifting ideas that fundamentally rethink how AI systems handle extended conversations

I want solutions that are both theoretically grounded and practically implementable, with consideration for computational efficiency, scalability, and real-world deployment constraints.

## Expected NWTN Output

This prompt should trigger comprehensive analysis across all 7 reasoning engines:
- **Deductive**: Logical analysis of context preservation requirements
- **Inductive**: Pattern recognition from existing solutions  
- **Abductive**: Creative explanation generation for novel approaches
- **Causal**: Understanding cause-effect in context degradation
- **Probabilistic**: Evaluating success likelihood of different approaches
- **Counterfactual**: "What if" scenarios for alternative architectures
- **Analogical**: Cross-domain pattern matching (biology → AI)

## Test Goals

- Validate complete 5-step NWTN pipeline with reorganized structure
- Generate academic paper length response (15,000+ characters)
- Demonstrate breakthrough insights from 177M+ reasoning operations
- Test Step 5 natural language synthesis capabilities
