# Enhanced FTNS Token-Based Pricing System
**Revolutionary LLM-Style Token Pricing with Market Dynamics for NWTN Deep Reasoning**

## 🚀 Overview

The Enhanced FTNS Token-Based Pricing System represents a breakthrough in AI pricing methodology, directly mapping computational complexity to token-equivalent units with market-responsive dynamics. This system brings the familiarity and fairness of LLM token pricing to advanced multi-modal reasoning while incorporating sophisticated economic mechanisms.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of arbitrary fixed pricing, FTNS costs are calculated using computational tokens multiplied by reasoning complexity, verbosity requirements, market conditions, and quality tiers - creating transparent, predictable, and fair pricing that scales with actual computational requirements.

## 🧮 Core Pricing Formula

```
FTNS_Cost = Base_Computational_Tokens × Reasoning_Multiplier × Market_Rate × Quality_Bonus × Verbosity_Factor

Where:
• Base_Computational_Tokens = Estimated processing units for query execution
• Reasoning_Multiplier = Complexity scaling based on ThinkingMode (1.0x - 5.0x)
• Market_Rate = Floating rate based on network supply/demand (0.8x - 3.0x)
• Quality_Bonus = Performance-based multiplier (1.0x - 1.5x)
• Verbosity_Factor = Output complexity scaling (0.5x - 3.0x)
```

## 📊 Reasoning Complexity Multipliers

| ThinkingMode | Multiplier | Description | Use Cases |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **QUICK** | 1.0x | Fast inference, minimal reasoning | Quick facts, simple queries |
| **INTERMEDIATE** | 2.5x | Multi-step reasoning, moderate analysis | Research synthesis, comparisons |
| **DEEP** | 5.0x | Comprehensive reasoning, all 7 engines | Complex research, breakthrough discovery |

### Deep Mode: 5,040 Reasoning Permutations
When DEEP mode is selected, NWTN runs all 7 reasoning engines (deductive, inductive, abductive, analogical, causal, counterfactual, probabilistic) in 5,040 different permutations to ensure comprehensive analysis. This justifies the 5.0x multiplier due to:

- **Computational Intensity**: 7! = 5,040 unique reasoning pathways
- **Time Requirements**: 2-3 hours of processing
- **Quality Guarantee**: Publication-grade reasoning quality
- **Breakthrough Potential**: Maximum chance of novel insights

## 📝 Verbosity Scaling System

| Verbosity Level | Token Target | Cost Multiplier | Output Characteristics |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **BRIEF** | 100-300 tokens | 0.5x | Key points only, concise summary |
| **STANDARD** | 300-800 tokens | 1.0x | Balanced detail level, most common |
| **DETAILED** | 800-1,500 tokens | 1.5x | Comprehensive explanations with examples |
| **COMPREHENSIVE** | 1,500-3,000 tokens | 2.0x | Full analysis with supporting evidence |
| **ACADEMIC** | 3,000+ tokens | 3.0x | Research-grade thoroughness with citations |

## 🏪 Market-Responsive Pricing

### Dynamic Rate Calculation
```
Market_Rate = Base_Rate × (1 + Supply_Demand_Factor + Network_Congestion_Factor)

Supply_Demand_Factor = (Active_Queries - Available_Capacity) / Available_Capacity
Network_Congestion_Factor = Current_Load / Max_Capacity
```

### Rate Categories
- **Low Demand**: 0.8x - 1.0x base rate (Off-peak hours, low network utilization)
- **Normal Demand**: 1.0x - 1.2x base rate (Standard operating conditions)
- **High Demand**: 1.2x - 2.0x base rate (Peak hours, increased activity)
- **Peak Congestion**: 2.0x - 3.0x base rate (Maximum capacity usage)

### Benefits of Market-Responsive Pricing
1. **Fair Resource Allocation**: High demand periods incentivize more contributors
2. **Network Optimization**: Price signals encourage off-peak usage
3. **Scalability**: System naturally adapts to increasing user base
4. **Economic Efficiency**: Market forces determine optimal pricing

## 🏆 Quality Performance Tiers

| Performance Tier | Multiplier | Criteria | Benefits |
|-----------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Standard** | 1.0x | Baseline performance | Standard processing |
| **High Quality** | 1.15x | >90% accuracy, <5s response | Priority queuing |
| **Premium** | 1.3x | >95% accuracy, <3s response | Enhanced support |
| **Excellence** | 1.5x | >98% accuracy, <2s response | VIP treatment |

Quality tiers are automatically determined by:
- **System Performance**: Current network performance metrics
- **User Tier**: Basic, Premium, Enterprise, Research tiers
- **Historical Quality**: Past performance and accuracy scores
- **Service Level**: Guaranteed response times and accuracy

## 💰 Practical Pricing Examples

### Example 1: Simple Factual Query
```
Query: "What is quantum computing?"
• Base_Tokens: 50 (simple factual lookup)
• ThinkingMode: QUICK (1.0x)
• Verbosity: STANDARD (1.0x)
• Market_Rate: 1.1x (normal demand)
• Quality_Bonus: 1.0x (standard performance)

FTNS_Cost = 50 × 1.0 × 1.1 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 55 FTNS (~$0.03)
```

### Example 2: Research Synthesis
```
Query: "Compare quantum error correction approaches for near-term quantum computing"
• Base_Tokens: 150 (moderate complexity)
• ThinkingMode: INTERMEDIATE (2.5x)
• Verbosity: DETAILED (1.5x)
• Market_Rate: 1.2x (normal-high demand)
• Quality_Bonus: 1.15x (high quality service)

FTNS_Cost = 150 × 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.15 = 776 FTNS (~$0.39)
```

### Example 3: Deep Research Discovery
```
Query: "Analyze the implications of quantum supremacy on post-quantum cryptography 
       with focus on lattice-based protocols and their vulnerability assessment"
• Base_Tokens: 300 (complex multi-domain analysis)
• ThinkingMode: DEEP (5.0x)
• Verbosity: COMPREHENSIVE (2.0x)
• Market_Rate: 1.4x (high demand period)
• Quality_Bonus: 1.3x (premium service)

FTNS_Cost = 300 × 5.0 × 2.0 × 1.4 × 1.3 = 5,460 FTNS (~$2.73)
```
