## üìù Description

The module `prsm/api/main.py` currently lacks comprehensive unit tests. Adding tests is crucial for:

- Ensuring code reliability and preventing regressions
- Documenting expected behavior
- Making future refactoring safer
- Improving overall code quality

**Module details:**
- File size: 76648 bytes
- Suggested test location: `tests/test_main.py`

**What to test:**
1. All public functions and methods
2. Edge cases and error conditions
3. Integration between components
4. Performance characteristics (if applicable)

This is a great way to learn about the codebase while contributing to its reliability!
